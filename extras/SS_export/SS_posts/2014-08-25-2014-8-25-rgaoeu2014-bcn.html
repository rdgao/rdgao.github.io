<p>    <em>You know the feeling you get when you almost doze off in class, but not quite? At which point, the most bizarre thoughts would materialize and you become imprisoned in an imaginary wonderland, feeling that things aren't quite right though you'd been reduced to a mere spectator, half conscious. If you had known just a bit more, you'd be able to reason your way out of this mess, or realize that you are in a mess in the first place. Fortunately (or not), something always jolts you awake, but in that split second of regaining consciousness, you're never certain whether you've re-entered the physical universe, or that you've finally become lucid in a world of your own rampant imagination.</em></p>
<p>    My window neighbor had decided to lift the cover, through which a violent streak of photons thrust me back into consciousness. I've always felt weirdly triumphant about crossing time zones on the plane, almost as if the sun had become subservient to the speed and elevation of the flying titanium tube I'm sitting in. My musing immediately turned into excitement, however, when I saw that we were descending towards civilization, neatly trimmed by an endless coast of ocean blue. I struck up a conversation with my aisle neighbor, adamant that I would not let this turn into a silent and awkward plane exit when everyone just sits there waiting like third-graders for the stewardess to tell us that it's now okay to get up - to prove that I was committed to change, damn it! It turned out to be awkward anyway, though, because after you bid each other a safe journey on a plane, everybody proceeds to walk the same kilometer between the plane and the custom.</p>
<p>    I wasn't sure why I was in Barcelona. I mean, I knew why I was here: the cheapest plane ticket I found after two weeks of scavenging was one that flew into Barcelona...I guess that's reason enough. Honestly though, I didn't know much about it, other than a few friends vouching that it was their favorite city, and, of course, it being the home of FC Barcelona.</p>
