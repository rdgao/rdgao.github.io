<p>I've just finished being a teaching assistant for the 5th time, and being on the other side for this long made me realize a few things that I had not appreciated when I was an undergraduate - or highschool, even - student. The 5 classes were wildly different, from intro to engineering design when I myself was still an undergrad (Praxis, probably the most notoriously arbitrary EngSci class), to a 30-person advanced machine learning class where the best kids could go toe-to-toe with me, to this quarter, where I TAed for a 500-person intro to cognitive science class where the experience felt more like herding stray sheep than being a TA at a world renowned university.  </p>

<p>I have just finished being a teaching assistant for the 5th time now, once during my own undergrad, and 4 times as a grad student. My physical, intellectual, and emotional involvement have been wildly different for these 5 classes due to their different requirements. Because of that, I feel like I have now experienced a wide enough range of situations that I can gather up a memoir of experiences, both for myself in the future as an instructor, as well as for any unsuspecting, green-eyed undergraduate students out there. While being a TA is obviously not the same as being a full-blown professor teaching the class, it does offer you some rare insights on the main product of the whole higher education machinery - as well as small but rewarding joys and facepalm-inducing pains - that I wish I had accrued earlier, as a student, and as a TA. </p>
<p>The TLDR version, though, is as the title says: if you're a student, the key to doing well is basically to not be an asshole to your professor and TAs, whether you realize it or not, and to think just a little bit more. This might sound condescending, and might make me appear removed from the harsh lives of a struggling undergrad, but that's the point of this post - what I offer now are guarded secrets! (not really.)</p>
<p>These are, of course, my own experiences, and cannot be generalized to all TAs &amp; professors, nor do they prevent me from being sympathetic to the plight of everyday undergrads. Though, having been a grad student for 2 years now and in much closer contact with professors, I do believe this will be useful advice in most schools and majors. In fact, this is exactly the advice I wish I could give myself for when I was in undergrad. Hell, I just visited my high school last week and I realized this firmly applies there as well.</p>

<p>What does it mean to "not be an asshole?" Let's step back for a second. Starting from when I remembered things and actually learned shit in school, so say, since high school, I've always thought that teachers and the educational system are all pretty much figured out, and that everyone knows what they're doing and is just acting as cogs in the big machine. This means that courses were optimally designed, grading is done objectively, or as objectively as possible, and that teachers are impartial, even robotic, in their assessment of students' work. As a result, I thought I could just do the work to the best of my abilities and therefore be judged fairly based on what I did. Furthermore, this made me treat my professors and TAs as if they were robots, in that their one role, as far as I was concerned, was to relay material from their brain to mine. For me, everything was business-like, and every interaction was, to some degree, directly relevant to the course material. I rarely went to office hours because I worked really hard to figure it out on my own, and because I didn't think TAs were there to babysit me. Luckily, because I was in engineering, and most things were objectively right or wrong, I don't think I suffered any negative consequences for this, at least not as a student.</p>
<p>What never occurred to me, until this past year really, is that teachers, professors, and TAs alike, are all human beings.</p>
<p>I'll just talk about the two classes I TAed for in the last 12 months, because they were pretty much on the two ends of the spectrum of experiences. The first class was a 30-person, advanced undergrad machine learning class. The best kid in that class could probably (read: did) teach me a thing or two, especially given that my background was not in ML. I was probably assigned this class simply because I was okay at math in my department. The second class I TAed for was a 500-person, intro-level cognitive science class</p>
