<p>Some background for my non-neuroscience friends: the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) is a huge academic conference, drawing 30000+ attendees and 10000+ poster and podium presentations, all under the gigantic umbrella of "neuroscience". For scale, the Air Canada center seats about 18000 people, so imagine more than half of the people in a packed Raptors game giving presentations over the span of 4 and a half days. At a lack of better words, it is a zoo. This year, it was held at the conference center in Washington, DC. Since I actually jotted down some detailed notes, both about the science itself as well as some feelings and/or random musings I had while walking 20000 steps through the poster hall every day, I figured I'll share them here.</p>

<li>The posters are organized by subfields, so if your poster is about neuronal morphology, it will be physically close to those of similar nature, and probably in the same poster session. How do subfields get organized then? My hypothesis is that they are placed across the poster hall such that people that are the least likely to interact are placed as far apart as possible. This makes a lot of sense, which usually means pure biology at very detailed levels are on the opposite end of pure mathematical modeling, but there definitely DO exist people that create detailed models of neuronal morphology, for example.  So for me, it has never been more painful, literally, to work at the intersection of cellular neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling, because those 3 subfields literally spanned the entirety of the poster hall, which is about 400 meters in width here. Honestly, if sending an email to a potential collaborator in another subfield doesn't stop you from interdisciplinary collaboration, this walk probably will...</li>
<li>Related to the layout, literally every person I've talked to had made this complaint: most of the posters I really want to see are in the same presentation time block as me. Again, this makes sense, because the most similar topics are grouped into the same group, but that means everything that's relevant to my work I will not be able to see. So what's the happy middle ground here? We obviously don't want to scatter similar things so far apart that it's incoherent, but the other extreme, which is placing all the similar things in a single session, doesn't make sense either, because then you're not presenting to the people that actually care about your work. I wonder if SfN has some kind of algorithmic decision process for poster placement. Yes, I am aware that we have a 1-hour assigned slot to present, but let's be real, nobody leaves their poster outside of that one hour to go see other people's posters, because god forbid that someone with helpful comments will come by and you're not there. What did help was to have a lab mate there to take over for me while I raced around my section quickly to see what I had planned to see.</li>

<p>- i feel stressed by all the things going on at sfn as a graduate student, because everyone is doing cool stuff and many of them similar to what im doing. but stepping back, as a person interested in neural sciences, it’s really cool to see SO many different kinds of work converging in the same place, spanning from detailed biology to purely behavioral work</p>
<p>- start to develop an attention to details: specific behavior, specific brain area, specific timeline, etc. things that probably don’t matter in theory but very much so in practice, especially methodological details in experimental settings</p>
<p>- multi-level paradigm as the bread and butter: integrating multiple levels of investigations, specifically, including spikes, field potentials, and computational theory with behavior</p>
<p>- i have a TERRIBLE elevator pitch, especially for scientists that are kinda familiar with comp neuro and methods, but not the exact phenomenon i’m working on</p>
<p>- symposium style presentation (usually PI-level talks): start with a anecdotal story or something mundane and everyday, and move into introduction, then a regular science talk. nano-symposiums act more like data dumps, which skip the first framing part because people are usually aware of the context</p>
<p>- constructive skepticism: recognize everything that could be “bad” in a study, and think of ways to improve upon it</p>
<p>- the most valuable activities at sfn: socialize (both schmooze and catching up), talk to people at their posters, get feedback on my own poster, and quickly learn the history and state of the art in an unfamiliar field</p>
<p>- people often reason about neural computation using very intuitive arguments, like representational capacity of a network</p>
<p>- people enjoy when their work is read, more so when it’s received positively (duh).</p>
