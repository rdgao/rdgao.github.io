<p><em>What?</em></p>
<p>    To what extend have the 1) efficacy and 2) mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine been reported in published scientific studies?  </p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>    This review is mainly the result of a conversation with my mom, who swears by how effective Chinese medicine is in treating body-wide and non-specific issues. The question is not whether it is effective, because I believe most Chinese people have had successful treatments (myself included), and a billion people in China receive it as the co-primary method of care. Also, my intuition tells me that a few thousand years of trial and error should have resulted in some useful conclusions that are passed down from generation to generation, which could very well be unfounded in the scientific sense. In fact, a few pharmacology breakthroughs in Western medicine every year are just that- stumbled upon, especially when it comes to treating psychological disorders [1]. The question is, rather, to what extend has the positive effects of traditional medicine been studied and explained. I'm going to lay out my disclaimer here that I wholeheartedly (and my mother too) believe in Western medicine, and in no way am I encouraging homeopathic treatments in place of scientifically proven medicine. I also don't claim any expertise in pharmacology, only drawing on my basic knowledge in biochemistry and electrophysiology to understand what I'm about to review. That being said, let's get the show on the road!</p>
<p><em>How?</em></p>
<p>    I'm going to limit my scope here to include only herbal medicine and acupuncture. Herbal medicine, probably like all pharmacological compounds, are extremely hard to study systematically. Not only is it hard to trace the exact mechanism of action through which it heals the body, my guess is that we don't even have any clue as to what the active ingredients are in a particular pot of black stew. But at the very least, we can see if there are any clinical studies with positive results. Similarly, I don't have much hope for finding a good explanation of acupuncture, but clinical studies will be satisfactory. In fact, that is how I will organize the review: <strong>a brief overview of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), reported clinical success, and finally, proposed mechanisms</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong> (aka a read-through of the Wikipedia article [2])</p>
<p>    Without going on too much of a tangent, I will summarize what I think is relevant: </p>
