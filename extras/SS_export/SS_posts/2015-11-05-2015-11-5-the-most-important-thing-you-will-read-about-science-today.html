<p>I've gotten into several conversations recently about communicating science to people, probably because I'm taking a class called "Communicating Science", but also because (thankfully) the community around me actually cares about how to properly and effectively talk about our science to the public, the media, funding agencies, and of course, our grandmothers. At one point, I really thought that science communication is only necessary when your science sucks, and now, I'm beginning to believe that communicating science is just as important, and perhaps more so, than the science itself. </p>
<p>For most of my life, I believed that science is factual, it was about the truth of the universe and the truth only. And if someone were to discover a new fact about the world we live in, or about the biological machinery that is our own bodies, it should be deemed important. Well, being in graduate school for a year can change your outlook on many aspects of life, such as the necessity of solid foods and good hygiene. But most importantly, it really changed how I viewed science, and it was because of a fundamental, though seemingly trivial, realization: science needs an audience. Unless you're working in pure math or philosophy (in which case you'd probably be fine with not being read plus there's always the possibility of finding fame after you're dead), or if you've discovered the DNA, producing science requires you to communicate that science to somebody every single step of the way: you have an idea, you need to convince your advisor that it's not a stupid idea; you observe some cool results with great interpretations, you need to convince a journal to publish you; paper gets sent back, you need to convince your reviewers that you're not an idiot but you're not saying they're idiots either; you need money to feed yourself, you have to write that grant telling the foundations how great and important your science is. The point is that, you, as the scientist, can only do so much in shaping the final outcome of your work, the rest of the process involves other people's understanding of your work, and communicating effectively means raising the probability of you being heard and understood.</p>
<p>If you're in academia, all of the above should (hopefully) not be groundbreaking news. Whether you begrudgingly accept it or happily embrace it, the fact is, somebody else needs to understand what you're doing, and what implications your science has. Some people believe that scientists have a responsibility to communicate their work effectively, but I don't really like to think of it as a responsibility, it's more like a necessary skill, because, after all, communication is an integral skill that will effectively determine whether and how much you get paid. Maybe this depends on the specific field, because I'd imagine a physicist probably doesn't have to do as much convincing since, well, you found what you found and they can suck it if they don't like it. But in neuroscience, and health sciences in general, things are pretty vague right now (to say the least), and to be considered good science, most experiments require (1) an airtight interpretation, and (2) a potential to be impactful.</p>
<p>(1) is pretty simple, it comes from being a good scientist, or a good thinker in general. It's not necessarily EASY, but it's straightforward, and if you cover all your bases and do the necessary controls, it should be clear that the assumptions you're making are reasonable and lead directly to the interpretation you're making. Clear communication is obviously good here, but it really doesn't require too much fluff, though that's not to say people don't have problems with keeping things clear and concise. (2), however, is a trickier thing to navigate, and threading the needle between impactful and sensationalist is the topic of today's rant.</p>
<p>Deep down, most of us want our science to have an impact on the world, because that would be cool. But deeper down, we're often just super interested in a specific problem or a strange phenomenon in nature, and the impact of solving it is truly a secondary thought. </p>
