<p>Really, why do we have tenure?</p>
<p>This might be an extremely unpopular opinion given that I'm in an environment of current and future academics, and it could also serve to be one of those moments that bites you in the ass much later on, i.e. if I ever was in a position to be protected by tenure (academic-god willing). But seriously, what is the point of tenure? </p>
<p>This is not a rant, but an in-depth and historical analysis of tenure, with an conclusion that can be summarized succinctly in one sentence. In other words, TL;DR: great teachers won't need tenure, and we won't even realize the shitty teachers are gone.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong><br>Nice and easy: when the hell did this concept of tenure begin? For that, we refer to CLICK HERE a short Times article, which means, assuming you're out here looking to procrastinate by reading Trivial Pursuit facts instead of doing what you were actually suppose to, you should just go read it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Justifications</strong><br>research freedom (read: blank years. why would you keep someone around producing nothing? because they might possibly in the future? is this the only industry that doesn't give a fuck about who they sell to, only what they're selling? then why not stress over every single researcher, because they might always start producing at some point, right?)<br>unpopular research (what does that even mean? that global warming isn't a thing? racial discrimination isn't a thing? marijuana is not devil-lettuce?)<br>unpopular class content (this might be the only legit reason, if you gave enough of a shit to teach well-crafted but controversial lectures, which does not include "vaccination might cause autism here try some scented potpourri". <br>unpleasant person? (yeah but he's a great researcher so he has tenure? let's reward shitty interpersonal skills so we can further perpetuate the stereotypes that academics all look like Jamie Fox in the Amazing Spiderman.)<br>incapable teacher? (I had one such prof, great researcher, might be on route to curing heart diseases, terrible teacher, possibly skipped more lectures than I did (seriously), and you're telling me I'm paying fucking 10k a year because of the quality of education I will get here? WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING A NOBEL-PRIZE WINNER FOR A PROF IF SHE WON'T SHOW UP?)<br> </p>
<p>University is a business. So why the hell do professors act like it's not? Oh because that's the only justification for academically awarded tenure. Why not keep great researchers in a research lab, and great teachers in a university, and if they happened to be great at both, golly, why don't we let them be at both? What's that you say? They might not have time? Gee, I sure hope my heart surgeon who's cross appointed in the med school is gonna have enough time to see his patients. Why the fuck would we expect our academics pure hearted and science-driven, while everyone else gets to chase money? Plus, even if that pipe dream is true, I'm pretty sure the smarter folks (those who realized that this professor job is a fucking gold mine) would have wormed their way in by now. Sure it's half or a quarter of the money you'll make a year as a CEO but how many CEOs are there that make 100k a year...EVERY YEAR TILL THEY CAN'T WALK ANYMORE? Why not pay your professors like you pay a programmer, or a market rep, or a sales rep, or fucking literally every other profession: pay them well when they do well, then fire them when they show up 3 years in a row producing no perceivable work, and leave it up to them to find a job whenever they feel like clocking in again? </p>
<p>Tenure denied: so wait, you're telling me this guy got rejected for tenure (read:fired) for non-research issues, but you would've happily had to keep him employed had he only been outrageous AFTER he got tenure? And if it was because he wasn't producing research, how do you know that he just wasn't ruminating on a low-key idea, you know, like you assume that he is HAD HE HAD TENURE?</p>
<p>The long and short of it, is that if you're worrying about getting fired as a professor, you'll probably do something about it. One is to be smarter, but I'd think that if you could just become smarter, you would've done it ages ago. Which only leaves you one other option, like, you know, to teach better. I have never, as a student, looked at a prof that was a great instructor with the feeling like...yeah but do they really deserve tenure for being a good teacher? I wonder if their research is up to par? Conversely, without fail, I will look up a terrible prof praying to my bank account that they're the next Stephen Hawking or Marie Curie because I seem to be paying to breathe their carbon dioxide, for which I would be willing to make a forty thousand dollar bet on, on the off chance that doing that might actually increase my IQ. But, without fail again, I find myself disappointed and think, fuck that guy and his shitty research. Next time UofT tries to convince you to go to that school, ask them for the average rating of a teaching professor, because you sure as hell won't be affected by their citation count, and you can't absorb Nobel-ness just by sleeping in that class. The ultimate solution, in my perspective, is still to separate church and state, I mean research and teaching. That might increase misaligned incentives for research? Uh, you mean there weren't irretrievably misaligned incentives right now, like doing enough to get government grants, whose leading monkeys shit lobbying money? Oh that's not too bad? What about patenting lab-created technology? </p>
