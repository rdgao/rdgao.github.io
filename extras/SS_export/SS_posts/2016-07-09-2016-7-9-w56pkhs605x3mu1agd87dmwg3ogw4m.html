<p>People used to joke about how black kids all aspire to become actors, athletes, or rappers. That's not so much a joke as it is a sad truth. Back then, every successful person of color represented in the media has been one of those 3 - they certainly were not Presidents, or any other regular profession for that matter. TV shows rarely showed black doctors or lawyers or even characters as protagonists. This has a pervasive, subtle, yet profound effect.</p>
<p>I grew up seeing successful Asians as computer scientists or accountants or some kind of general geeks, so nowadays when an Asian tells me they're studying to become a doctor or banker, I'm like yeah makes sense. But if an Asian was like "I want to run for office." I'd be like uh what, not even due to any conscious objection, just a vague feeling of weirdness - I've never seen that in my life. </p>
<p>Actors and athletes these days demand a tremendous amount of respect and exposure, but rappers - or hip-hop artists - were a representation of grass-root activism that resonated with the average working black man. Obviously you had to be hardworking, but you had to be also talented and lucky to be a Jamie Foxx or a Michael Jordan. But any brother down the block can practice the poetic craft and go to open mics, and speak to the world around them, as big or small as any individual's own world is. This gave people power, and more importantly, hope. Hip-hop was a way to both assert competitive dominance and demonstrate mutual cooperation and understanding - that I could slay you with words when we spar, but we walk hand in hand on issues that matter. </p>
<p>And then it became something else. When I started listening to popular rap music in the early 2000s, it was almost always about killing somebody, selling drugs, or both. Before that, sure, it showed up in places, as much as you'd expect, proportionally to how many people had to go through that life to make a living wage, but no more than that. Tupac would talk about life and struggles and personal stories, good and bad, for 11 songs, then drop something like hit em up for the 12th. But as the years went on, rap music became more and more stupid, and I mean that in a very literal sense - not artistically stupid, but stupid in its messages. It became about grillz and Jordans, getting turnt, and killing somebody (including cops) if they don't agree with you on anything. That was the most perplexing thing when I first started to listen to rap music: don't these records of people talking about selling coke and killing cops count as confessions? How the hell are they still walking around NOT in prison then? </p>
<p>Then I learned, it's just a saying. Sure, 50 Cent actually got shot like 10 times (probably), but rarely had someone talked about pulling up on somebody or sold drugs by the bricks and proceeded to do it. When Bobby Shmurda was in court, this guy was like "oh naw I was just playing." But the message is received by their listeners, loud and clear. And who are their listeners? Young black males that want to be successful and rich and provide for themselves and their family.</p>
<p>Sure, the odd white and Asian boy would get hit with the fever and feel some way about themselves back in the days (hahaha), but it was largely an outlier-like component of their lives: they knew it, their parents knew it, their friends and their friends' parents knew it. Plus I knew, if anything, I'm not black so I could never be successful as a rapper (shoutout to Jin and timothy delaghetto tho lol). So after indulging in a buffet of profanities once in a while, it was back to Sunday math classes. But for a lot more of black kids, this was what they can dream about when they want to aspire to be successful. No kid wants to shoot a cop for no fucking reason, but every kid wants to live the lifestyle that can afford you to buy anything you want. Obviously, I'm not saying every black kid in America wanted to be a gangsta rapper, but that was an overly represented lifestyle that trickled down into the ears and consciousness of the working class. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, shooting guns and selling drugs became irreversibly linked to successful rappers. But kids didn't know it was all an act, especially when you put a bunch of tween boys together in what's basically a dick measuring contest. They will compete to act the hardest, be the most dangerous, and hopefully along the way, become the most successful. For suburban kids in a healthy home and proper schools, it was maybe a fist fight or a good shoving, but in a housing complex where parents were off working two jobs just to get by, it was buying a gun or join some friends that have guns. </p>
<p>You know what was really striking to me? Eminem just started to get huge when I was fresh off the boat in Canada, and he was, to me, just another very successful rapper. I sorta knew it was weird that he was white, but he pretty much normalized me to the concept of non-black rappers. So it always stood out to me how he was just about on everyone's top 5 list, but almost NEVER rapped about pulling up on cops or sell drugs by the brick. Sure, he talked about strangling people or ending them in various other disgusting ways and sang about DOING drugs, but it was clearly a different set of unlawful behavior, something that doesn't warrant a cop shooting you in self defence.</p>
<p>And here we are today. We have been normalized to the image of the black male as gun-totting, drug-selling gangsters. Kids in a mixed race school knew that they were just guys in your class or on the same basketball team. But for places where interracial interactions are hard to come by, that's the peoples' concept of young black males. Meanwhile, rap music has got black kids killing themselves for shit they don't need, and resorting to violence because that's the way of conflict-resolution they are exposed to. They say music is a language with no barrier, but when one house party plays Mozart and another plays G-Unit, do their recipients hear the same thing?</p>
<p>I don't know the history of how this transpired, and I'm not that big of a conspiracy theorist to say that white people bought out artists by shaping the industry that way (not inconceivable though), so I will just say: this has got to stop. Someone might get their feelings hurt reading this thinking, well who are you to shit on black culture like this? To which I would say, hip-hop is black culture, lyrical activism is black culture, but violence and wearing pants at the knees are not black culture. How do I know? Everyone in the 50s and 60s were well-dressed, even at rallies and protests. It was just as cool for a black man to wear a nice suit as it was for a white man. But now, you're spending just as much on your outfit, except it's for Js on your feet. And until we start paying due respect to music with real messages and advices for our young - blacks and whites and Asians alike - the loudest voice in the room is the one calling for destruction, and police departments will continue to have the preemptive self-defence card to play. </p>
