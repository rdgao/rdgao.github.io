      <title>Year 3 (and a half): TIL my PhD is Flappy Bird.</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/12/17/year-3-and-a-half</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's January of 2018.&nbsp;40 months after I started my PhD. Wow. I know people say that the years feel shorter as you get older, but these days are just zipping by way too fast. I realized somewhere in October that I forgot to write one of these for my third year, and all of a sudden, we're in 2018. So I'm late, what else is new.</p><p>This post is broken into two parts. The first part is about a recent shift in attitude I had on how to process failures and other "negative" emotions throughout the PhD, during which I also realized that getting a PhD is more like staying alive in Flappy Bird than running a marathon. Between when I started writing this post and now (~10 days), I've had two major rejections already (one paper, one conference submission). I'm still learning how to process these things, but what you will read below is my take on some wisdom I received through reading. The second part contains habits and lifestyle changes I've acquired over the last year or so, that I think contributed positively to my general well-being.&nbsp;<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: none of what you're about to read are meant to be advice, they're more or less just entertaining chronicles of my graduate school adventure. But if you happen to find them useful or comforting, that's all the better!</p>

<hr /><p><strong>PhD - Perpetual heap of Discomfort</strong><br />I thought PhD was like a marathon, and in some ways, it is - it's grueling, long, and most of the time you're by yourself. But in a marathon, every step you take contributes to getting you to the finish line. In a PhD, not so much. It's more like this:&nbsp;imagine stepping off a cliff way above the clouds, and you're falling through a mysterious unknown. Your trajectory has been determined, and many, many things will come straight at you, largely outside of your control. And you know, with every passing second, that you're falling (probably to your death), and it's scary as hell. That being the case, your attitude through the fall could be one of two things. The first is to completely reject the reality that is the unstoppable force of gravity and helplessly flail, feeling strong emotions at every possible opportunity. That could be a positive or negative emotion: maybe you see a branch that might stop or slow your fall, or maybe you hear the snap of the branch that you thought would save you. All of these little events in their individual moments seem disconnected and unrelated. From that perspective, their causes could either be that you personally are doing something right/wrong, or that life is being especially gratuitous/unfair. Through these three and half years, sometimes I blamed life and the people around me, and often I blamed myself, which starts the vicious cycle of unhappiness: "I seem to be falling.&nbsp;I see and grasp at every little thing, but things often don't work out. Now I'm still falling and even more stressed out. Am I not learning quickly enough? How is everyone else doing this so gracefully? I wish I wasn't falling. Oh shit, I'm still falling. Ugh... can't I get a break or do something right?"</p><p>In hindsight, that's not the only way to experience this perpetual fall and those emotions along the way, but I didn't even consciously realize that that was a choice I was making, or that I even had a choice. A few months ago, I read "Man's Search for Meaning" by Victor Frankl, and in it I found a piece of wisdom that would go a long way in helping me unlock and process my feelings of free-fall during my PhD, as well as life as a whole during these few years. In it, he says something to the effect of:&nbsp;<strong>in this day and age, people have a tendency to not only put themselves in situations where they are unhappy, but they then become unhappy about their unhappiness, because they have a need to be happy all the time.</strong>&nbsp;After chewing on this for some time, I asked myself:&nbsp;have I been unhappy during these years, and have I been unhappy about my unhappiness, especially those unhappiness that stemmed from factors that were a natural progression of being in graduate school in a foreign country (which also happened to be a dumpster fire with a steady stream of shitty news to look at on Twitter)? I think the answer was yes.</p><p>All of the shitty stuff - work failures and personal failures -&nbsp;are real, and in a way, it's not my fault. It's not anybody's fault. I don't mean that life for graduate students can't be made better by the institution as a whole - it certainly can. Nor am I deflecting responsibility from the things that I could have done better, like starting a deliverable early to avoid stressing myself out last minute. But I think a part of me put such a heavy expectation on this graduate school experience to be positive that I rejected the possibility that my unhappinesses were a product of the situation I put myself in, but rather time and time again blamed it on how much life sucks or how badly I'm doing as a researcher.&nbsp;This doesn't mean I haven't been happy at all.&nbsp;Quite the opposite, actually: I regularly find joy in the work I do and the progress I've made, the new friends I've made and the experiences we've shared, and the beautiful city and its ocean breeze I now think of as my new home, as well as the cherished opportunities I get to see my old home and everything it embodies. But these moments of happiness are fleeting, as all moments are. Except, their endings only thrust me back to the reality of my falling, against the expectation that each happy moment was suppose to mean that I have figured life out, and that the feeling of falling should have disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The realization that many aspects of my current situation made me unhappy was powerful, and quite a relief. It's difficult to put them into the right words, but there's a profound difference between the mindset that things are really great overall and there are just unexpected wrinkles along the way, versus the mindset - the more accurate one I'd say - that this process as a whole is challenging and frustrating, and inevitably will make me unhappy, and that's perfectly fine, and I shouldn't be too hard on myself or anyone around me because of it. When I left for San Diego three and a half years ago, I kind of just hopped on a plane and left. I didn't think about how hard I made it for myself to see my family and old friends, experience the comfort of home in Toronto, and in general the challenges of starting life in a completely new place. On top of that, never did I really think about the challenges of doing a PhD, the real and daunting challenges that many before me have faced, which, summed in one phrase, is a relentless feeling of failure and uncertainty, both real and perceived.</p><p>So what now? In Frankl's book, one of the things he talks about, within the framework of logotherapy - or logically looking at ourselves -&nbsp;is that we have a choice in changing our situations. Taking responsibility for my own happiness has always been my mantra, which, I think, was why I felt inadequate or that I always have to do more to improve my own situation. But to change my situation, I have to first accurately assess my situation, and these short-term ups and downs, in a way, were largely predetermined by the choice of being in graduate school 3 years ago. Yes, specific failures and disappoints may be avoidable, but they will inevitably come in one form or another. Of course, I can also choose to drop out at any time, and that would definitely alleviate certain aspects of this feeling of falling. But if I wanted to stick it through, I'd first have to acknowledge that failures, successes, more failures and the feeling of being not good enough even after successes are all a part of this process. A lot of people in academia, to their credit, acknowledge the reality of anxiety, stress, and things like imposter syndrome, for example. Every time I read a blog post on that, I think to myself: "everyone feels it, it's not a big deal, and it makes sense to feel it, so I shouldn't feel it now, because understanding it means I'm above it now. Right?" Wrong. No matter how many times I'm confronted with this feeling, and no matter how many times I feel satisfied with a piece of work I did, this feeling has not gone away, and to be honest, I don't think it ever will. So my new resolution is just to embrace this feeling, and embrace the fall. Something else that helped is the Buddhist perspective (or philosophy?)&nbsp;that even "negative" emotions and events can be observed, appreciated, and understood (I really like Thich Nhat Hanh's writing about this in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Being-Peace-Thich-Nhat-Hanh/dp/188837540X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1515982322&amp;sr=8-1">Being Peace</a>), and that's an invaluable treasure in life, just as the happy moments are.</p><p>(As I finish writing this, I am realizing that the falling process I described as getting a PhD is basically <a target="_blank" href="http://flappybird.io/">Flappy Bird</a>&nbsp;rotated 90 degrees:&nbsp;something is always propelling you forward, and you more or less can't control how fast you go forward, even though that's what you're measured on. Instead, the effort you exert feels almost orthogonal to the direction you want to move towards, but nevertheless, it's those little actions that keep you afloat and moving. Actually, that sounds like life in general. Holy shit - life is Flappy Bird.)</p><hr /><p>That being said, I think there were a few things I did over the last year or so that definitely contributed positively to my mental and physical well-being. Most of them fit in the larger theme of finding what works for myself, so no guarantees that it will work for anyone else, but it might be worth a try:</p><p><strong>Moved off-campus</strong>: La Jolla, nice as it is, is not very good for living, especially as a 25 year old with a diverse taste for cuisines (here comes the Soylent jokes). More importantly, living on campus literally meant that I live in the same place as I work, so I basically didn't really live, and just worked. Turns out, living in a place where I can walk for more than 15 minutes and not having to stop because there's nothing but highways is nice. Plus, I'm now in an area much closer to my friends, and spending quality social time (or get college-student-drunk) is definitely good for the soul! Also, having to take the bus for 30 minutes to and from work means there is a significant chunk of time away from my laptop, which brings me to...</p><p><strong>Casual reading</strong>:&nbsp;sometimes I still spend the whole bus ride thinking about projects, but on most days I get a full hour of casual reading. I think I've read more books this year than I have in the rest of my life combined, and this sounds really stupid coming from a 26-year old, but books are great stuff!&nbsp;On the surface level, being immersed in a really good fictional narrative completely reenergizes my mind, and honestly on some days I look forward to that bus ride more than actually going to the office (or anything else in life) because of the book I'm reading. On a deeper level, the books themselves, both fiction and non-fiction, have had transformative effects on my life. I'd been meaning to put together a list of my personal favorites (who knows when this will happen), but top of my list so far: the Glass Bead Game, Dune, Half a Yellow Sun,&nbsp;All the Light We Cannot See, and I already mentioned Man's Search for Meaning. Is this always good for productivity? No, because on some days, I would get to the office and read for another half an hour because I just can't put it down. But do I enjoy it? You're goddamn right I do. Shoutout to the people who have recommended or lent books to me, and my bookclub buddy (spoiler: it's my girlfriend) who patiently reads the weird shit I want to read and picks books that I would've never read otherwise.</p><p><strong>Mid-day workout</strong>: I now go to the gym before lunch for an hour and half every day, either to play basketball or to lift. I've even turned down free lunch events because it overlapped with my gym time. *GASP* I know, right?&nbsp;Why was this helpful? For one, I feel like I'm in the best physical shape I have been for a while, which definitely helps me feel good about myself, especially during times where everything else is crap (running theme: how to have a good day when life is shit otherwise). The other benefit is that taking that midday break to do something active really helps the blood circulate to my brain again, because if there's anything I learned about myself during grad school, it's that I can't sit still for more than 3 hours and still be fully there mentally. I've tried various routines to overcome this, but working for 8 continuous hours a day always resulted in me dozing off for the second half of the day, no matter how many hours I've slept before or how many coffees I have. Midday nap doesn't even do me as much good as exercise. I think the combined effect of adrenaline and breathing more deeply is a much more natural stimulant for the brain, and it has to come during the early afternoon for me, because going to the gym at night after a long workday (during which I've fallen asleep many times at my desk) is doubly ineffective.</p><p><strong>Waking up earlier</strong>:&nbsp;The awkward thing about exercising midday is that, of course, I'm now working like 5 hours a day instead of 7, even though those 5 hours are all good, focused hours. To compensate for this, I usually try to wake up early (like at 6 am) to put in two extra hours, have a late breakfast, and go to the office. Because I woke up SOOO early (6 is hella early for a grad student!), I get sleepy by 9pm, which means I'm in bed at grandma hours, and the virtuous cycle continues. I'm really digging the tripartite workday now (work, breakfast, work, gym + lunch, work), and the added benefit is that even if I'm completely unproductive on campus for whatever reason (meetings, teaching, etc), I still feel good about the 2 hours I got done before my day even started. The only thing this isn't good for is socializing on a weeknight, because it screws up the next morning.</p><p><strong>Keeping a lab notebook</strong>: working on computational projects means I usually try many many things before something worthwhile happens, and sometimes a whole day has to be spent on things like debugging code, or learning some software package. All this means that a lot of work has to be done before I see any real results, and that feels bad. Also, I find myself always referring back to simulation or analyses I did in vague ways because I can't remember the details, but just remembering that it was interesting/important. So after the Nth time of that happening, I decided to keep track of my daily explorations and progress in Evernote. In hindsight, this makes a lot of sense, because that's what people in wet labs do. I guess I just felt that computational stuff happens so quickly that it's not worth writing down. But hey, even if it doesn't matter, seeing a full notebook definitely makes me feel good even if nothing concrete came out of it yet, and that, my friends, is the word of the day today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>26/52: Our thin layer of existence.</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/10/8/2652-our-thin-layer-of-existence</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hawaii was an absolute treat for the senses, where almost every single day we witnessed something that was breathtaking: be it the sun setting into the infinite expanse of the orange horizon, the warm saltiness of the sea water on the skin that's just cool enough to alert the peripheries, or the chirping of countless <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA_9_zAK5sA">coqui frogs</a> going in and out of synchrony while the jungle leaves rustle peacefully under the backdrop of the star-lit night. Words are not enough to really convey these perceptions, and to be honest, neither are pictures, but <a href="/hawaii-2017">we tried anyway</a>. One idea that cannot be conveyed without words, however, is the feeling of our minuteness I got - both me personally and human lives in general -&nbsp;when I witnessed just a little more of the world around us.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>Traveling to new places is always an eye opening experience, especially when immersed in the ecology and culture of a foreign place. This was different, though - it revealed to me something that I foolishly thought I already knew intimately -&nbsp;the world in which I live.&nbsp;It's like this:&nbsp;imagine you're about to visit someone's house for the first time. It's cool, because you know you'll see things you've never seen before, or at least how the same things might be arranged differently, so it's an expected kind of novelty. Now imagine sitting on your own couch at home, with an abundance of familiarity surrounding you. Everything was either put there by you, or it's been there for so long that it might as well have come with the place. All of a sudden, someone whispers a few words into your ears and you watch the familiarity in front of you unfold into an entirely new experience, realizing for the first time that there is so much more to your home than meets the eye. Hawaii gave me that feeling about this "world", "my" world, and not just through its exquisite wild life on the surface, but extending from the depth of the ocean to the stars above. The whole two weeks were full of moments like those, but I will just describe a few things that happened over a span of 48 hours on the Big Island (Hawaii Island).&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>The Earth shaping itself</strong><br />The state of Hawaii is a chain of islands formed by underwater volcanic activity. I knew this, and it makes sense. How else does a chain of islands emerge in the middle of the ocean? I didn't know, though, that there are <strong>active</strong> volcanoes on the Big Island. That fact seems routine enough when you read about it, but being there and witnessing it is another thing. We visited the Volcano National Park, where the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halemaumau_Crater">Halemaumau Crater</a> spews out a thick stream of never-ending smoke during the day, and transforms into a scary demonic pit at night. The park itself is a huge area of land that surrounds the crater, as well as the aftermath of some of the more explosive eruptions from a few decades ago. The landscape is incredibly eerie. It simultaneously makes me appreciate the wrath of Mother Earth, fear her swiftness in taking life away, and marvel at the incredible youth of the land beneath my feet and its newly sprouted inhabitants. When I think of a young Earth, I think of spring and budding greens. But here, youth is charred black, porous, and honestly looks kinda deadly and downright alien.&nbsp;</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>The youthfulness of the land was further exhibited the next night, when we went to the edge of the park where lava is pouring out down the slope of the mountain and into the ocean. The feeling that we are standing there and witnessing NEW EARTH BEING BORN is truly incredible. Land is literally being formed around us, and the rocks we stepped on were younger than any of their visitors (and there were some hardy toddlers braving the lava rock hikes in the pitch black night). It was a sublime reminder that the world around us is dynamic, constantly morphing, swallowing itself and rebirthing itself - not only do plants and animals cycle through life and death, so too does the Earth they stand on.</p><p>Shit I never ever think about.</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><hr /><p><strong>The world outside of our world</strong><br />I've always lived in crowded places with extremely dense light pollution. Among those, La Jolla is probably the only place where I can regularly see more than a handful of stars at night. I've heard of friends going out of the city to star gaze, but have never done it myself, nor have I ever really camped in my life (I know). So imagine my awe when we went three quarters way up Mauna Kea (9300 ft), which is the dormant volcano on the Big Island and peaks at almost 14000 ft!!! There a lot of cool little tidbits about this mountain, one of which being that the base of it is actually <strong>deep </strong>under the ocean, so deep that if you measured from the base to its peak, it's just slightly taller than Mount Everest at 33,000 ft. Driving up to observatory altitude is the embodiment of "0 to 100 real quick". I think we went from beach to 9300 ft in about an hour? On the way up, we had to drive through a layer of super dense condensation (aka clouds), and it is a local saying that many people hit the invisible cows on the way up and down the mountain because visibility around the foggy area is no more than about 10 m ahead of you. But beyond that, the sky above feels like it reaches the depth of the universe. After nightfall, it's as if we were transported to another dimension or planet outside of our own, because I've never ever seen that many stars shining so brightly. Apparently, from Mauna Kea, one can see every star available in the northern half of the sky, and about 80-90% (?) in the southern sky, because, you know, it's a tall ass mountain.&nbsp;</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>Standing under that diamond studded ceiling, we got to see a lot of astronomical phenomena firsthand, through our own eyes (and sometimes through a telescope).&nbsp;For example, there were guides at the visitor information center that set up small telescopes for the crowd to take a closer look at the stars, and I actually saw for the first time Saturn and its ring. It looks like a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deepskywatch.com/images/articles/see-in-telescope/saturn-in-small-scope-n.jpg">miniature, cartoon version</a> of the Saturn I'm used to seeing in books and films: a small tilted ring encircling a smaller dot, both unicolor with a gray sheen. It was pretty neat. We also saw the ISS racing through the night sky in a perfect broad curve, and several shooting stars. By far the most indescribable feeling, though, was the smallness of humans and our planet under such a majestic sky. Standing on top of the cold peak, it was like the universe and all its mysteries were suddenly opened to me - I am directly experiencing, for the first time ever, how vast the space is out there and how little we really knew.</p><p>It wasn't quite a religious moment, but that was as close as I've ever gotten to marveling in the creation of some higher being.</p><hr /><p><strong>The world within our world</strong><br />I've posted this before, and I have to post it again. I've watched this video myself about 20 times now, and every time I do, I can't help but have a big stupid grin on my face. There are just so many completely spontaneous opportunities to witness animals enjoying themselves, be it a manta ray tumbling around, a family of sea turtle surfing the current, or a pack of dolphins playing hide and seek with us in the bay.</p>

</div><p>As a surface-dweller, my idea of life is mostly concentrated around my altitude and on dry land.&nbsp;Rarely do my thoughts venture out into the other 70% of this planet. The waters around Hawaii, though, really made me feel that there is life all around us. Perhaps they're different, and look a little strange, but life nonetheless. Breaking through the thin surface of the water that separates two worlds, you are instantaneously immersed in another storyline, like an invisible fly on the wall with the special privilege to witness the completely normal lives of all its characters. In those moment, I felt acknowledged and welcomed, and I hope I can do the same for them one day.&nbsp;It really makes me question, even now, the extent of other kinds of cognition, beyond our simply human ideals.</p><p>After all, we are but a thin layer of existence in a much, much larger whole.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>25/52: First research paper published!</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/9/18/2552-first-research-paper-published</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because I'm quite short on my 52 posts this year, I'm stealing this from the <a target="_blank" href="http://voyteklab.com/inferring-ei-balance-from-lfp/">lab blog</a> (which I wrote!). But hey! First research paper published, jeez what a long process...</p><hr /><p><strong>Highlights (tl;dr)</strong></p><p>The overarching goal of our recent <em>NeuroImage</em>&nbsp;paper (<a href="http://voyteklab.com/wp-content/uploads/Gao-NeuroImage2017.pdf">PDF</a>) is to make inferences about the brain’s synaptic/molecular-level processes using large-scale (very much non-molecular or microscopic) electrical recordings. In the following blog post, I will take you through the concept of excitation-inhibition (EI) balance, why it’s important to quantify, and how we go about doing so in the paper, which is the novel contribution. It’s aimed at a broad audience, so there are a lot of analogies and oversimplifications, and I refer you to the paper itself for the gory details. At the end, I reflect a little on the process and talk about the real (untold) story of how this paper came to be.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>A Tale of Two Forces</strong></p><p>Inside all of our brains, there are two fundamental and opposing forces – no, not good and evil – excitation and inhibition. Excitatory input, well, “excites” a neuron, causing it to depolarize (become more positively charged internally) and fire off an action potential if enough excitatory inputs converge. This is the fundamental mechanism by which neurons communicate: shorts bursts of electrical impulses. Inhibitory inputs, on the other hand, do exactly the opposite: they hyperpolarize a neuron, making it less likely to fire an action potential. Not to be hyperbolic, but since before you were born these two forces were waging war with and balancing one another through embryonic development, infancy, childhood, adulthood, and till death. There are lots of molecular mechanisms for excitation and inhibition, but for the most part, “excitatory neurons” are responsible for sending excitation via a neurotransmitter called glutamate, and “inhibitory neurons” are responsible for inhibition via GABA.</p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/59c0ac641f318d7ed8ccbbc8/1505799282628/EI.png" alt=""/>


<p>Like all great rivalries (think Batman and Joker, Celtics and Lakers), these two forces cannot exist without each other, but they also keep each other in check: too much excitation leads the brain to have run-away activity, such as what happens in seizure, while too much inhibition shuts everything down, as happens during sleep, anesthesia, or being drunk. This makes intuitive sense, and scientists have empirically validated this “excitation-inhibition balance” concept numerous times. This EI balance, as it’s called, is ubiquitous under normal conditions, and has been proposed to be crucial for neural computation, the routing of information in the brain, and many other processes. Furthermore, it’s been hypothesized, with some experimental evidence in animals, that an imbalance of excitation and inhibition is the cause (or result) of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism, just to name a few.</p><p><strong>Finding Balance</strong></p><p>Given how important this intricate balance is, it is actually quite difficult to measure at any moment the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. I mentioned above that there is empirical evidence for balance and imbalance. However, in the vast majority of these cases, measurements are done by poking <strong>tiny </strong>electrodes into single neurons and, via a protocol called voltage clamping, scientists record <em>within</em>&nbsp;a single neuron how much excitatory and inhibitory input that neuron is receiving. Because the setup is so delicate, it’s often done in slices of brain tissue kept alive in a dish, or sometimes in a head-fixed, anesthetized mouse or rat – basically, in brain tissue that can’t move much, but not in humans. I mean, imagine doing this in the intact brain of a living human – yeah, I can’t either. And as far as I know, it’s never been done. This presents a pretty big conundrum: if we want to link a psychiatric disorder to an improper ratio between excitation and inhibition in the human brain directly, but we can’t actually measure that thing, how can we corroborate that EI (im)balance matters in the way we think it does?</p>

<p><strong>Our Approach: Parsing Balance From “Background Noise”</strong></p><p>This is exactly the problem we try to solve in our recent paper published in <em>NeuroImage</em>: how might one estimate the ratio between excitation and inhibition in a brain region without having to invasively record from within a brain cell (which is not something most people would like to happen to them)?</p><p>Well, recording inside a brain cell is hard, but recording outside brain cells – extracellularly – is a LOT easier. It’s still pretty invasive, depending on the technique, but much safer and more feasible in moving, living, behaving people. Of course, recording outside the brain cell is not the same as recording the inside – when we record electrical fluctuations in the space <em>around</em>&nbsp;neurons, rather from within or right next to a single neuron, we’re picking up the activity of <em>thousands to millions</em>&nbsp;of cells all <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Local_field_potential">mixed up together</a>.</p><p>The first critical idea of our paper was that this aggregate signal – often referred to as the local field potential (LFP) – reflects excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto a large population of local cells, not just a single one. Therefore, we should be able to get a general estimate of balance by decoding this aggregate signal. The second piece of critical information was the realization that (for the most part) excitatory inputs are fast and inhibitory inputs are slow so that, even when they are mixed together from millions of different sources like in the LFP signal, we are still able to separate their effects: not in time, but in the frequency-domain (see our <a href="https://github.com/voytekresearch/tutorials/blob/master/Power%20Spectral%20Density%20and%20Sampling%20Tutorial.ipynb">frequency domain tutorial</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Combining</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Computational</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Modeling</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and</strong><strong>&nbsp;Empirical (Open) Data</strong></p><p>Pursuing this line of reasoning, we simulated populations of neurons <em>in silico </em>and looked at how their activity would generate a local field potential recording. What this means is that we can generate, in a computer simulation, different ratios of excitatory or inhibitory inputs into a brain region and see how that influences the simulated LFP. Through this computational model we found an index for the relative ratio between excitation and inhibition.</p><p>For those of you that are into frequency-domain analysis of neural signal, this index is the 1/f power law exponent of the LFP power spectrum. Let’s unpack that a bit. In the figure above (panel B) you can see that the excitatory electrical currents (blue) that contribute to the LFP shoot up in voltage really quickly—within a few thousands of a second—and then slowly decay back down to zero. In contrast, the inhibitory currents (red) also shoot up pretty quickly—but not <em>as</em>&nbsp;quickly—and then decay back to zero <em>much</em>&nbsp;more slowly than the excitatory inputs. When you add up thousands of these currents happening all at different times, the simulated voltage (panel C, black) looks to us humans a lot like noise. But through the mathematical magic of the Fourier transform, when we look at this same signal’s frequency representation, they’re clearly distinguishable!</p><p>More technically, the idea is that the ratio between fast excitation and slow inhibition should be represented by the relative strength between high-frequency (rapidly fluctuating) and low-frequency (slowly fluctuating) signals. With this hypothesis in hand, we were able to make use of several publicly available databases of neural recordings to validate the predictions made by our computational models in a few different ways. One example from the paper: we were lucky enough to find a recording from macaque monkeys undergoing anesthesia, and the anesthetic agent, propofol, acts through amplifying inhibitory inputs in the brain at GABA synapses. Therefore, we predicted that when the monkey goes under, we should see a corresponding change in the power law exponent, and that’s exactly what we found! As you can see below, our EI index remains relatively stable during the awake state, then immediately shoots down toward an inhibition-greater-than-excitation regime during the anesthetized state before coming back to baseline after the anesthesia wears off.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways and Disclaimers</strong></p><p>So to summarize, we were able to make predictions, borne out of observations from previous physiological experiments and our own computational modeling, and then validate these predictions using data from <strong>existing databases</strong>&nbsp;to draw a link between EI balance, which is a cellular-level process, and the local field potential, which is an aggregate circuit-level signal. Personally, I think that bridging the gap between these different levels of description in the brain is super interesting, and it’s one way for us to confirm our understanding of how the brain gives rise to cognition and behavior at multiple scales. Furthermore, we can now make use of the theoretical idea of EI balance in places where it was previously inaccessible, such as a human patients responding to treatments.</p><p>Before I wrap up, I just want to point out that <strong>this paper does not conclusively show that EI balance directly shifts the power law exponent</strong>&nbsp;– what we show is a suggestive correlation. Nor does the correlation hold under all circumstances. We had to make a lot of assumptions in our model and the data we found, such as the noise-like process by which we generated the model inputs. I’m not throwing this out here to inhibit the excitement (hah, hah), but rather to limit the scope of our claim, especially for a public-facing blog piece like this.</p><p>Rather, ours is the first step of an ongoing investigation, and although we will probably find evidence that <a href="http://voyteklab.com/more-evidence-1f-lffp-noise-indexes-excitationinhibition-balance/">corroborates</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042">contradicts</a>&nbsp;our findings later on, it’s important that anyone reading this and getting excited (hah) about it understands that we do not, and likely will not, have the last word on this. Ultimately, though, I believe we stumbled onto something pretty cool and we’ll definitely follow up on those assumptions one by one, and hopefully have more blog posts to come!</p><p><strong>Some Personal Reflection</strong></p><p>This project was my first real scientific research project in grad school, and it definitely created in me a lot of joy and excitement, as well as caused a fair amount of brooding. As a whole, I really enjoyed the process of building a computational model, even if it was quite simple, and using the predictions from that to inform further empirical investigations. As I mentioned, I think we really need to bridge the gap between molecular-level mechanisms in the brain and circuit/organism-level “neural markers”, and computational modeling work allows us to do that in situations where it would be intractable for many reasons. I certainly subscribe to the notion that combining theoretical/computational work with empirical data is an exciting and fruitful line of research, because it fills a space between two successful but largely non-overlapping subfields in neuroscience (though that trend is now changing).</p><p>Also, the fact that we were able to test our predictions on publicly available data was such a blessing, as we simply did not have the capacity, as a new lab, to do those <em>in vitro</em>&nbsp;and <em>in vivo </em>experiments ourselves. However, that meant combing through tons and tons of data where there might have been unlabeled or badly labeled information, only to reach the conclusion that the data is unusable for our purposes. There was some (a lot) of headbanging due to this, but ultimately, we found useful (FREE!) data and I’m very grateful for the people that made them available:&nbsp;<a href="https://crcns.org/data-sets/hc/hc-2/about-hc-2">CRCNS</a>&nbsp;and Buzsaki Lab,&nbsp;<a href="http://neurotycho.org/">Neurotycho</a>&nbsp;and Fujii Lab, as well as many friends and collaborators that donated data for us to test different routes. To support this open-access endeavor, all code used to produce the analysis and figures are on our lab GitHub, found <a href="https://github.com/voytekresearch/eislope">here</a>.</p><p><strong>The Untold Story</strong></p><p>One last note, for those of you that find the process of scientific discovery interesting: in this blog post, I tried to write the story as a lay-friendly CliffsNotes version of the paper, starting with the importance of EI balance and the motivation to find an accessible index of it in the LFP, then outlining how we went about solving that problem. That’s the scientific story, and while not false, it’s not chronological.</p><p>The actual story began with <a href="http://voyteklab.com/journal-of-neuroscience-paper-age-related-changes-in-1f-neural-electrophysiological-noise/">Brad’s 2015 paper</a>&nbsp;showing that aging is associated with 1/f changes. That was actually what first interested me back when I started in 2014 – this seemingly ubiquitous phenomenon (1/f scaling) in neural data. After digging a bit to find various accounts for how 1/f observations arise in nature, we decided to just simulate the LFP ourselves and see what happens. Turns out, the 1/f naturally falls out of the temporal profile of synaptic currents, which both have exponential rise and decay.</p><p>Our model contained what I thought to be the bare minimum: excitatory and inhibitory currents. At that point, I didn’t have a clue about what EI balance was and what it has been linked to. I think I was twiddling parameters one day, and realized that changing the relative weight of E and I inputs will cause the 1/f exponent (or slope) to change because of their different time constants. Then, like any modern-day graduate student, I Googled to see if this is something that actually happens <em>in vivo</em>, and the rest was history. This little anecdote really just speaks to the serendipity of science, and it couldn’t have happened without the many hours of spontaneous discussions in the lab, which I’m also very grateful for, and Google. I think these little stories really liven up the otherwise logical world of science, and I’d love to read about such stories from other people!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>24/52: Holy sh*t I swam with a manta ray: the most incredible and awe-inspiring thing I've seen.</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/8/26/2452-the-most-incredible-and-awe-inspiring-thing-ive-seen</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We saw a lot of wonderful and incredible sights in Hawaii over the last two weeks, all of which I will shortly detail. But the one thing that stood out the most was this moment, so much so that I think it deserves its own entry.</p><p>We were snorkeling at Two Steps Beach on the Big Island, near Captain Cook. It was a treasure trove of marine life with an abundance of corals, but by that point we had been in Hawaii for a week and half, and everything I saw became unremarkable in that everything was routinely remarkable. I was swimming over to the other end of the bay to meet Mei on the beach, still hopeful that I might see a dolphin or two, when this great white shape appeared - about the size of me - and fanned out in front of me.</p><p>My immediate feeling was that of fear, since it's not a run-of-the-mill experience to come face to face with a wild animal the size of myself on land, and who knows if this creature is benevolent. Even if it doesn't eat me, what if I pissed it off by swimming near its home?&nbsp;This feeling of apprehension never quite went away, but gave way to so many more: excitement at this rare opportunity, curiosity in this strange beast, joy in watching it tumble round and round in the water. So I followed it around for two minutes, just out of reach. Not that it seemed to care.</p><p>I hate to anthropomorphize nature but in this moment, it's impossible to not ponder the mind of this being, as it performed its strange dance. Perhaps joyously, perhaps hungrily.&nbsp;All of these thoughts and emotions combined themselves into a single concept -&nbsp;awe - and I found myself completely immersed in the presence of another entity in its undisturbed natural habitat, wondering just how many more lives like this one surrounded our thin surface of existence, evading our consciousness.</p><p>Without further ado (only edit I made was adding the music, over which you can still sometimes hear my gasps):</p>

      <title>23/52: What is the hardest scientific endeavor of all? (Answer: neuroscience)</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/6/12/2352-what-is-the-hardest-scientific-endeavor-of-all-answer-neuroscience</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"The brain is the most complex thing in the universe."</p><p>If there was one quote that grinds my gears more than all else, it is this one. It is simply an idiotic thing to say: the brain is not the most complex thing in the universe;&nbsp;the universe, which contains billions and billions of brains small and big, is the most complex thing in the universe. Even the interaction between two brains, certainly, is more complex than the brain itself. So why is neuroscience, the scientific study of the brain, the hardest of all?</p><p>Let's take, as two examples, quantum physics and astrophysics, fields that study the tiniest and the grandest objects in our universe. These are extremely difficult things to study, because to even observe the signals necessary to start answering the questions we've set forth, it takes some real human ingenuity and delicate engineering to construct devices that can give us reliable measurements we can then use to make inferences. Watch this really great <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iphcyNWFD10">video</a> on LIGO and the detection of gravitational waves if you are not convinced, and coincidentally, it is a combination of both quantum physics and astrophysics (4:45 is the best part...why are they even wearing goggles?)</p><p>If that's not the craziest thing I've heard of, which is literally at the physical boundary of the universe (as we understand today) on both the smallest and the largest scales, I don't know what is. Maybe putting people on Mars? Maybe Elon Musk's new brain hat? Which brings me to how much more difficult neuroscience is. Actually, it's not just neuroscience, it's all scientific efforts that try to study some aspect of the human mind, like psychology and cognitive science, but not, for example, neurobiology. And the reason I believe this is not because neuroscience is intrinsically hard - it most certainly pales in comparison to many branches of the physical and even social sciences.</p><p>What makes it hard, I think, is that it is incredibly difficult for a human to be objective when we study the brain and the mind:&nbsp;the phenomena we are interested in explaining are the ones that occur on a daily basis in our mundane lives, like paying attention to traffic, perceiving color, etc,&nbsp;and it is precisely these subjective experiences that we not only draw inspiration from, but also try to dissect as if they are objective things in the universe. I certainly don't want to get into the debate of what is and what is not objectively real, a photon or consciousness, but I think we can agree that one is more objectively existing than the other, at least in terms of how we operationalize them scientifically. In fact, I think the more "dead" we think something is, the easier it is to study it objectively, which might explain the incredible disparity in our level of understanding of the brain compared to every other organ in our body. When we study the brain and the mind, confirmation bias does not only creep in at the objective scientific level, but the personal level as well. Yes, we can be diligent in checking results that confirm our hypotheses, but it is damn near impossible to be diligent in checking results that are consistent with our daily experiences and intuition. After all, if I've had these experiences, it must be the right, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Why is it so hard? I'm not sure, but if I were to venture a guess, I think it is rooted in our wish to preserve our own identities, livingness, and humanness. One of the things that makes us humans feel special is the belief that we are special: yes, dogs and cows and rats and dolphins all have brains, but we must be special in some way? And if we were to lose this feeling of specialness in the pursuit of an objective understanding of the brain and our humanness, we would paradoxically lose this humanness altogether. In fact, I believe it is crucial that we treat the human brain like we treat any other organism on this planet in order to properly study it, but that would create such an intense dissonance, because at the end of the day, when we're done being neuroscientists, we're back to being regular people -&nbsp;a friend, a spouse, a parent - all of which requires this special humanness to maintain, this special belief that we're all the good guys at the end of the day.</p><p>I recently finished reading Paul Kalanithi's When Breath Becomes Air, and his story contextualized our scientific effort in understanding the brain in a way that's never explicitly occurred to me before -&nbsp;though I soon realized afterwards that it's always been an implicit motivation for me, and perhaps for many others - and that is the search for meaning. I believed that we can ultimately objectively define the meaning of our existence by understanding the brain, the organ that presumably gives us this sense of meaning - our joys, pains, struggles, triumphs, and every other thing we feel -&nbsp;in the first place. Now that I consciously think about it, I don't know whether this will ever happen: to objectively understand this sense of meaning, we may have to give up that there is any meaning in the first place, and simply describe our thoughts, movements, and interactions as physical quantities changing over time, like how we objectively describe ant colonies, economics, and a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2011/11/starling-flock/">murmuration of birds</a>.</p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>22/52: The Disease of Productivity &amp; Mindful Dishwashing</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/6/5/2252-the-disease-of-productivity-mindful-dishwashing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I started graduate school, I think, I've revered industriousness and have been deathly afraid of unproductivity. It's really weird, because I was just as gung-ho about doing well in high school and university, but in some sense I felt like at that time my life (and work) wasn't really mine, and that I was just doing the bare minimum required to get the grades I was supposed to get, but no more -&nbsp;I was on a bus being driven to and fro. Even though EngSci was extremely time-consuming, I still had some "down time", where it was set aside to just hang out with people, get stupid drunk, or go play basketball. Actually, it wasn't "set aside" as much as I was doing anything to not spend time on school. Could I have gotten, better grades, been more involved in extracurriculars, or developed SOME kind of interest or hobby outside of school? Probably.&nbsp;But to be honest, the concept of setting aside time to do things as an investment of my future never occurred to me, and I just did whatever I wanted to do.</p><p>The moment I started graduate school, though, there was a fundamental change in my mindset. The best way I can describe it is that I began to think of my time doing research/reading/whatever as if it was time working on my own business: I get back as much as I put in, and no more, so if I want to be successful - and there is literally no bounds on what that means - I have to put in as much time as possible. In other words, every second of my time is a resource that I have to spend wisely to get the maximum return on investment I can get, and at this point in my life, it's through working or reading or better equipping myself for research one way or another (narrow-minded, I know). From that moment on, I was always trying to preoccupy myself with work, and I convinced myself that unlimited industriousness is good. Of course it is - there are countless numbers of motivational videos on Youtube, and many times more of quotes saying hard work is the secret to life.&nbsp;</p><p>After three years, though, I'm starting to think it's becoming a condition of some sort that I cannot get rid of. I don't know what specifically I was thinking about, but one day I had a thought that perpetual and uncontrolled laziness or procrastination is like a disease, since a person may literally feel as if they have no control over their inability to get started on doing work. And it dawned on me - I have just as little control over my inability to <strong>NOT</strong> think about work. Of course, that's not to say that I'm always actually doing work, which is the stupid and ironic part, because I'm also starting to realize that, pushing myself or not, I end up doing about the same amount of work, except in one case, I feel extra bad that I'm taking time off so I just end up procrastinating doing something that I don't really want to do, like watching the same video of Gordon Ramsey cooking a steak 5+ times on Youtube. For a while, I tried to consciously set aside time to relax by doing things that's not work. But that never really worked, because I would just think that I could be spending this time doing work instead.</p><p>Now I realized I had it backwards: I was depending on the activity itself to relax me, but the truth is that relaxation comes from the conscious decision to do this thing - anything - instead of thinking about work. This happened a lot for meditation: I noticed that during times when there are no immediate deadlines, meditating is a huge boost to my energy level and general sense of wellbeing. But when I'm in a period of high stress because a deadline is approaching or just particularly busy with multiple things, meditating not only does not help, but makes the situation worse, because I end up getting distracted by work and then think that I should've just spent that time working instead. It was very frustrating because I thought meditating was suppose to make me more relaxed, not the opposite?! At some point, it dawned on me that meditation cannot make one's mind more relaxed, but it is the relaxed mind itself - one that happily embarks on the small journey of being mindful despite all the chaos engulfing and bombarding the mind with responsibilities and tasks - that makes one's mind more relaxed. In other words, more than half the battle is already won when I wholeheartedly commit myself to relaxing. Mind blown, right?</p><p>After a few more periods of alternating stress and relative idleness, I started to pick up on all the random little things that are truly indicators of my mental wellbeing. Willingness to meditate, of course, is probably a big one, precisely because it's something that is truly unnecessary, in the sense that it does not accomplish anything that "needs to get done". Going to the gym is another such thing. Household chores, in general, are pretty good litmus tests when I start to neglect them: dishes piling up in the sink even though I only cook like one meal a day, shirts not hung back up at the end of the day, etc. There is probably a direct inverse relationship between my daily cortisol level and how many times I flossed in the last week. Conversely, some things that I spend more time doing when I'm not doing well: Youtube, Twitter, and various other forms of social media, reading about random shit on Wikipedia or Buzzfeed,&nbsp;reading the news - though that's largely a non-issue now since I avoid that like the plague. Anyway, the takeaway here is that how I'm treating myself in the face of external pressures is the best indicator of my mental wellbeing. Obviously I'm not saying to goof off every time there is more responsibility at work or something. It is simply to say that perhaps we need more loving and caring, from ourselves,&nbsp;precisely when we are being demanded the most (wow that sounds super obvious when I write it down that way).</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>21/52: Combatting bias in science</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/5/29/2152-combatting-bias-in-science</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For week of May 22</p><p>This is the third post in my series of reflecting on the state of science, which, at this point, feels like it's more likely to be a given week's topic than not. In any case, today, I will be writing about bias within the selection process in science. This current line of thought has accumulated over several years and many broader conversations about affirmative action in both academia and industry with various people. I realize that affirmative action is a particular sensitive topic, and it seems like people are either super for it or super against it, so let me just start by saying that without a doubt I believe in the principles behind it, and given how recently it has become an adopted practice, it is a great first step towards balancing out structural inequalities. That being said, I think it is worth taking a closer look at to see how we are doing and what we're trying to achieve.</p><p>The impetus behind writing this actual post today came from an interesting <a target="_blank" href="http://drbecca.scientopia.org/2017/01/04/are-bias-and-privilege-free-phd-admissions-possible/">blog post</a> I recently read by (presumably) a fellow science blogger whom I only have Twitter relations with. In it, the author asks whether graduate school admission criteria, like GPA, previous lab experience, letters of recommendation, etc, are truly an indicator of future success, or are we simply selecting for previous privilege? And if the latter, how can we give opportunities to those who want to pursue science but did not have the luck of birth to prepare themselves for it? I found this post interesting because, while it was not the explicit purpose, it gave me insight on differentiating between personal and structural biases, the different goals we have for solving these issues, and how they need to be tackled differently. I just made up these categories on the spot, so forgive me if they are defined properly elsewhere.</p><p><strong>Removing personal bias helps selecting objectively and optimally</strong><br />I'll get the easy one out of the way first:&nbsp;imagine yourself as the hiring manager for a position in your company, or an academic researcher deciding on whether to admit a new student into your lab next year. Personal biases often come in the form of color and gender, and studies have shown time and time again that men are likely to be perceived as more capable than women, and white candidates more than black candidates. This <a target="_blank" href="https://facultyhiring.uoregon.edu/special-concerns/">page</a> from the University of Oregon on implicit bias during a hiring process details, with citations, many of the studies that have reported significant effects. The one I had in mind, for example, reports that "randomly assigning different names to resumes showed that job applicants with “white-sounding names” were more likely to be interviewed for open positions than were equally qualified applicants with “African American –sounding names” (Bertrand &amp; Mullainathan, 2004). These studies demonstrate that implicit bias is rampant amongst even the most "objective" professions, like science and medicine. Additionally, they almost always deal with gender and race, two things we can usually identify from resumes, applications, and certainly in person. While this is an ugly problem, it is fairly simple to fix as long as we commit to the value that equally-qualified candidates should have equal opportunities. As some of these studies have shown, once the interviewer is blind to the gender or race of the applicant, they are more likely to make an objective and unbiased selection, at least in terms of proportions of men-women or black-white selected. This is also why I dub this a personal bias: once we take the biases of the interviewer out of the equation, the problem (largely) disappears and objectively better candidates are more likely to be successful.</p><p><strong>Removing structural bias means selecting sub-optimally?</strong><br />Which brings me to the latter, and more difficult issue to tackle, and one that is discussed in the blog post I referenced above: structural biases. Structural (or systematic) biases are caused by systematic and historical issues in our society that makes one group of people more likely to be objectively qualified than another. In the context of academic research, a more qualified candidate will have, in order of importance: more research experience in labs during undergrad (or even high school), better recommendation letters from well-known researchers in the field, more well-rounded extracurriculars, better GPA, and potentially better GRE scores. If I was trying to choose grad students for my lab, of course I would more likely pick someone that has demonstrably proven that they can do good research, and I'll happily make the selection while blinded to their gender and race. The problem, though, is that these qualifications are more likely to belong to someone that comes from a higher socioeconomic background, or colloquially, people with "privilege". This is really not a contentious <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/news/is-science-only-for-the-rich-1.20650">fact</a>: if a high school or college student has to work a part time job to support themselves or their family, can we even expect them to have as much time to study for their exams, much less take an active interest in research and athletics? Here, we are faced with two difficult questions: first, are the more qualified candidates not deserving of pursuing their science dreams, since, after all, they still had to work hard for the things they've accomplished? And second, are the less qualified candidates less deserving, because they will make lesser scientists in the future? I think the answer to both is no, but the difficulty of these questions lies in the fact that they cannot be normalized by blinding yourself, the interviewer, to color and gender alone, but it is rather a choice we have to make collectively and consciously, after we figure out what our values are and what we are trying to accomplish.</p><p><strong>Let's clearly define our objectives</strong><br />So what are we trying to accomplish? On the one hand, it is simply trying to select the best prospective student possible. If this is the case, statistically speaking, it's better to pick someone that has better credentials, no question. There might be candidates that are diamond-in-the-rough kinds of bets, or maybe their story speaks to you personally such that you believe they possess the character, if not the expertise, to be a good scientist in the lab and a better person in the future. These are, for the most part, rare personal choices that have implications for only the personnel involved.&nbsp;On the other hand, there is the problem of placing underrepresented groups into positions of power, so that the cycle of systematic oppression does not continue. It is about giving poor and underrepresented people quality education and critical thinking skills so that they can hopefully help their community in the future. If this is what we aim to accomplish, and I believe we should, then we need to be upfront to ourselves and everybody involved that we, at any given time, may not be trying to find the most qualified candidate for graduate school or an important position in the government. It is certainly a priority to place competent people into jobs where others depend on them, but perhaps the number one priority is consciously equalizing the disproportionate representation of different gender, race, and more importantly, socioeconomic groups. This means having admission quota, and it means selecting under-qualified candidates over more qualified ones, and that is exactly the point. But more importantly, we have to be honest with ourselves about what we want to achieve, because what doesn't make sense is to say that we are battling inequalities, but then filling race or gender quotas with students whose parents are doctors or lawyers, and did undergraduate research under a Nobel Prize winner in an Ivy League school. Like I said, affirmative action in the form of student quotas is a first step towards consciously counterbalancing inequities, because intersectionality exists and there is a correlation between, for example, race and income. However, to say that quotas simultaneously select for the best candidates and try to equalize existing disparities is, if not disingenuous, then completely missing the point.</p><p><strong>Why bother?</strong><br />To end, I think it's worth talking briefly about why one might want to tackle structural inequalities, especially in science. One argument against it, for example, is that hardworking parents should be able to transfer those privileges gained to their children. If I'm an immigrant and broke into the elite ranks of doctorhood or lawyerhood, why should my children be punished for the position I've actively put them in where they don't have to face the hardship I've faced? Anecdotally, I find this attitude most common in Asian technical immigrants, because they often start out dirt poor in North America but rarely get recognized as a legitimate minority groups, so in a way, they get the short end of both deals. I don't have a good response to that, other than I think it's perhaps the right thing to do to give up some privileges for the betterment of society as a whole, and getting snubbed for Harvard or Stanford and ending up at UCLA is really not that big of a problem. What is a problem, however, is a lack of diversity in higher education, as well as in decision making roles in the government. White dudes with private endowments, to be fair, made significant contributions to mathematics and physics for most of the last 2 or 3 centuries. But we are now at a point in society where different groups of people can and do bring significantly different - and valuable - perspectives in tackling challenging scientific and societal problems, and those perspectives are crucial in recognizing, sometimes literally, that a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/joy_buolamwini_how_i_m_fighting_bias_in_algorithms#t-210362">problem exists</a>.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>20/52: On the reproducibility crisis and how theory in neuroscience can help to avert it</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/5/20/2052-how-good-theory-in-neuroscience-can-avert-the-reproducibility-crisis</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the second of a series of posts where I talk about the current state of science, and today's in particular will begin by looking at the reproducibility crisis, and how a seemingly technical problem can give rise to this real-world issue.</p><p>I was sitting in lecture for the class that I'm TAing this quarter last night - introduction to data science - and we began to talk about the current reproducibility crisis in science. The fact that reproducibility has been an issue, especially in biological and psychological sciences,&nbsp;is not news to me. In the last couple of years, there have been various accounts of this particular problem in the media, as well as scrutiny from the scientific community (see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970">here</a>, and an analytical explanation for neuroscience specifically <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/abs/nrn3475.html">here</a>). What caught my eye, though, was the graphic below, taken from the accompanying article from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble">Economist</a>:</p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/591fe4f015cf7d684f0745e9/1495262463305//img.png" alt=""/>


<p><strong>False Positive Results by Chance</strong><br />Briefly, this schematic aims to explain why there seems to be so many false positive (hence irreproducible) findings in science. They begin with the assumption that most scientific hypotheses are false, and only a small fraction (10% here) of them will turn out to be correct after data is gathered through experiments (panel 1). This seems consistent with intuition, since most of our ideas will turn out to be crap, and a lot of experiments simply don't work out. This is now purely personal speculation, but there seemed to be a kind of a golden-age of science - at least in biology - where fundamental and groundbreaking results were discovered in a flurry in the 80s and 90s. Nowadays, it seems harder to find the golden needle in a stack of hay, hence most of our hypotheses - the ones that we were so convinced would work after 3 beers with the lab - are probably wrong.</p><p>Panel 2: even with careful statistical analysis, an experiment has the possibility of returning a false positive or false negative result. For example, if we hypothesize that eating strawberries makes your brain larger, we will set out to gather data and test this relationship.&nbsp;We often use a p=0.05 threshold for significance, meaning that if there was indeed no real relationship between strawberries and brain size, then only 5% of the time will our experimental data - given the threshold we set - produce an effect large enough BY CHANCE that we then go on to interpret as true. It follows, then, that 5% of all false hypotheses will return positive results by chance, not out of misconduct (45 out of 900). Similarly, a portion of actually positive findings (true hypotheses) will be deemed false after our experiments, also by chance (20% of 100 = 20). So in the end, we end up with 80 (true positive) + 45 (false positive) = 125 positive findings.&nbsp;</p><p>Panel 3: of course, overwhelmingly, it is positive findings that actually make it out of the lab, so that we can make another headline that reads "Scientists discover _____". Now, if we go back and re-examine these 125 discoveries, it's likely that we will not be able to reproduce the majority of those 45 false positives (hard to get lucky twice). Hence, it seems that science is in a dire reproducibility crisis, since around a third of the positive findings cannot be reproduced by independent labs. There are real and systematic problems that make this happen. For example, bad incentive structures where a scientist is judged only by publications and citation counts will want to publish as much as possible to get grant funding and tenure so they can keep doing the science they love. In very few instances are these actually due to misconduct and conscious malpractice, and the scientific process was designed to catch these kinds of errors anyway. However, over time, sloppy standards get sloppier at no fault of any individual, and no one would bother to try to reproduce a work because reproducing someone else's exciting finding won't get you nearly as much recognition, so why not invest these precious grant dollars more efficiently? These are problems that most scientists acknowledge and lament, and wish to be different (I believe), so I won't belabor the point here, though I may write a separate post about these larger issues.</p><p><strong>How Theory Can Save Us</strong><br />What I want to focus on is a new insight I stumbled upon while looking at this illustration: people can't publish null findings. This fact is old as time itself, and even has its own name: <strong>publication bias</strong>. It describes the situation where the result of an experiment influences whether it will get published, and most of the time it's towards a positive bias. In other words, only "discoveries" tend to get published. I was exposed to and made wary of this the day I started graduate school, because neuroscience as a field seems to be one of the worst offenders of this. Almost every single person in the scientific community laments this, though efforts have definitely been made to curb this practice via mechanisms like pre-registration, where one shares the plan of an experiment prior to actually conducting it, clearly stating the hypothesis and expected finding. Publication bias is so pervasive that I never really stopped to think about why null findings are unsexy and unpublishable, until I saw that second panel in the schematic, and realized just how many more null findings there probably are compared to positive findings, and how much value these results would add to our body of knowledge about the brain at large.</p><p>But why aren't these null findings published? Essentially, it boils down to one thing: null findings are unsexy because it doesn't tell you anything informative.&nbsp;But failure to find anything is not uninformative on its own - it is only so because there is no theory behind why it should have NOT failed. Put it another way: if we think of most neuroscience experiments as fishing expeditions (biology is stamp-collecting, after all), going out into a random patch of sea and casting your net and not getting a single fish is not that surprising, therefore not very informative. However, if you are in the same patch of sea,&nbsp;lowered an empty bucket, and proceeded to not raise any water, this would be pretty informative, and certainly publishable. Why? Because our theory about the sea, water, and physics tells us that we really should expect to get water, and thus not getting water with a bucket means either: a) your bucket is leaking, b) physics is broken. Think about it: if in a well-conducted and well-controlled physics experiment that you found that an object did not drop to the ground after release, you wouldn't just say, "oh well, just another failed experiment, back to the lab tomorrow." No, you would probably publish a Nature paper saying you found a spot on Earth where there is no gravity. Expectations built from theory, or the lack thereof, is precisely what makes null findings informative or uninformative. If we have some expectations for how a neuroscience experiment would go - I'm not just talking about a hypothesis, I'm talking about the quantitative and falsifiable explanation we have in our heads FOR that hypothesis - then a positive and a negative finding would be equally informative. In fact, a negative finding is probably MORE informative, because it means your theory needs to be revised, which forms the basis of falsifiable science. But if we have no theory? A null finding is just another empty trip out to sea.</p><p>How will this help with the reproducibility crisis? Well, I think if we started to build actual neuroscientific theories that we believe in and can work with in a quantitative way, we will slowly be rid of the publication bias. After all, the most valuable artifact of physics is not the collection of empirical observations that we gathered in the last 200 years, it is the set of generalizable and useful theories we were able to abstract from and refine with the help of those observations. Similarly, a coherent theoretical framework in neuroscience and biology will shift the focus away from stamp-collecting and towards knowledge-building. Once the community at large accepts and values works that falsify theories or reproduce existing evidence, then we can move towards a sustainable incentive structure</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>19/52: On Arrival, Sapir-Whorf, and Reading Fiction</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/5/15/1952-on-arrival-sapir-whorf-and-reading-fiction</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Cover image source: Arrival)</p><p>When I was younger - I'm talking about middle-school age - I read all sorts of books for fun. Captain Underpants, Artemis Fowl, and Harry Potter immediately come to mind. As I grew older, though, I stopped reading fictions altogether, and the little leisure reading I did do, I read almost exclusively non-fiction or facts-of-the-world types of books. Not only did I stop reading fiction, I took pride in not wasting time on stories. After all, if I wanted to entertain myself with a good story, I can watch a movie in a tenth of the time, and I can use the other nine tenths to learn some more math and science (NERD!). This was partly because I was actually very busy studying math and sciences, and partly because I hated high school English so much that I thought it would turn me off reading forever, not understanding that people can actually enjoy reading Shakespeare and other literary works without explicitly analyzing the iambic pentameters and centuries-old metaphors. In any case, after a 10-year drought, I started reading leisurely again since last fall, because I now have an hour-long bus commute as a part of my day. At first, I read just as a way to relax and get away from my usual riveting readings about neuroscience. But slowly, I have to say, I realized that reading works of literature and seeing how words can be combined in different ways to describe feelings has literally changed the way I experience the world, and the way I experience myself.</p><p>If you've seen the film Arrival, or read the book, you will know that the premise of the story is that a linguistic professor was able to experience time in nonlinear ways due to the nonlinear alien language she learned. If you haven't, don't worry - that's not quite enough to spoil the movie and it's still worth a watch. While the notion that anything can warp our perception of time might take some stretch of imagination, the idea that language shapes the way we think does not. In fact, the movie itself cites the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a>, or the theory of linguistic relativity. I must say, when I heard Amy Adams make explicit reference to it, I felt a tiny geeky giddiness, because I actually learned about this in graduate school. It's the same giddiness I got when I saw Johnny Depp trying to upload his mind into a computer in Transcendence, even though that movie made no f-ing sense. Anyway, my understanding of linguistic relativity pales in comparison to some of my friends and peers that are actually conducting research on this very topic, but the gist of it is that language is <strong>necessary </strong>for complex thoughts,&nbsp;the thoughts we have depend greatly on the language we speak, and different cultures "think differently", in a way, because of the different languages they speak. When I first learned about this theory three years ago, it was pretty easy to digest, and made no great impression on me. After all, it was not at all surprising to think that a native Chinese speaker would think in Chinese, and because of the difference in vocabulary, some concepts and cultural customs are simply not transferable to an English speaker. But I think I took it too literally, and re-learning the theory once again through a movie, during a time that I am, in a way, learning a new language through literary works, made me appreciate it so much more.</p><p>In essence, language is not only a tool that we use to outwardly describe concepts and thoughts to others, it is also the primary tool that we use to communicate to ourselves - through thoughts. Furthermore, language literally gives us access to some concepts that would otherwise not exist. In other words, annotating something for the first time with language defines and "creates" it, especially if this "something" cannot be captured with any other sensory modalities. For example, if we did not have a word for apples, it's something that can still be materialized in our thoughts by ways of imagining its sight, smell, taste, and the sound the fruit makes when we bite into it. In that way, even though it will be a lot more difficult when you try to tell someone you want to buy an apple, the concept itself can (probably?) still exist, its meaning anchored through our senses. On the other hand, for something as abstract and fleeting as an emotion or feeling, it's quite difficult to capture without words. Try to think about "sadness" without using the word,&nbsp;you will probably need to resort to a bodily feeling, like a tightness in your chest, or some previous memory that put you in that state of mind, like when you dropped a perfectly good ice cream cone. Some people are incredibly apt at relating their previous emotional experiences to new ones, such that old memories of the same feeling can serve as an anchor, and perhaps this is the skill (or talent) of empathy. Unfortunately, I am not such a person, and my emotional memory is very limited, both in detail and in how far back I can remember, so I can't really rely on that to process even my own feelings time and time again, much less intuitively understand someone else's. In fact, I thought emotions were so uncomplicated that I actively maintained that there are, scientifically speaking, only 6 elementary and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ekman#Emotions_as_universal_categories">universal emotions</a> that can be described with single English words (happy, sad, angry, etc.).</p><p>For that reason, reading about detailed and intricate descriptions of how fictional characters feel, contextualized in the larger story where I understand their origins and goals and dreams and fears, has really opened my eyes to how <strong>I feel</strong>, and in turn, how others might feel. Many a times, I have read a passage with the joyous feeling that, not only does someone else -&nbsp;someone wielding this pen - understand precisely how I've felt before, but that they gave me the words so that I can for the first time understand how I feel myself. It's crazy. I recently finished reading All the Light We Cannot See, and I wrote a<a target="_blank" href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2017/4/17/1552-language-beetles-bruce-lee-all-the-light-we-cannot-see"> few weeks</a> ago about a particular passage that feels so mundane, yet it's so accurate in its description of the frustration and helplessness one feels while trying to read under distraction - even though it never used those words. Another example: I am nearing the end of the Glass Bead Game by Hermann Hesse, and the subtle descriptions of Joseph Knecht's tranquility and sorrow simply cannot be substituted by the words "content" and "sad". Without delving too much into the book, I feel like I've learned for the first time that it is possible to think and feel at the same time, and in turn how I can process other people's simultaneous thoughts and feelings on the fly. To me, it feels like wiping the condensation off of my mirror for the first time and seeing a part of myself I've never seen before. And with that, I feel like I understood the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis just a little more, and I'm pleasantly surprised that it actually has implications in my own personal life. Actually, the idea that reading quality literature gives you a window into someone else's feelings is not new: I remember reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2017/4/17/1552-language-beetles-bruce-lee-all-the-light-we-cannot-see">this</a> a few years ago but apparently completely forgot about it, probably during a time where I thought: "leisure reading? hah, that's nice." But evidently there is scientific support for the theory that literature can make you more empathetic to the feelings of others.</p><p>Extending this away from feelings and into a broader context: can you imagine a world without concepts of freedom, justice, and democracy? Well, I'm starting 1984, so I guess I will soon find out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>18/52: Should all science have implications?</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/5/6/1852-should-all-science-have-implications</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Cover image source <a href="http://www.azquotes.com/quote/87348">here</a>&nbsp;and I honestly don't know if Einstein even said it.)</p><p>Edit: this is a <a target="_blank" href="#">sick video</a> that shows basic curiosity-based (strange) science leading to unexpected dividends. He actually acknowledges this at 15:35 in the video. (Thanks Connor!)</p><p>I've recently been thinking a lot about the social side of science, including the current state of science in North America, public funding for science, public perception of science, science communication, and social responsibilities of scientists. Over the next few months, I plan on writing a number of posts that detail these haphazard reflections in an attempt to consolidate some meaningful take-aways. Today, I will start with this fundamental question about science: should all scientific investigations have an implication?</p><p>Let's get the easy stuff out of the way first. I'm not asking whether all science <strong>will</strong>&nbsp;have implications, because it invariably does. Even if you're studying the most obscure thing, like how mussel clams produce glue to stick onto boats, the knowledge of the thing itself gives you an ability to predict and manipulate it, and that is an useful implication. Whether anybody else cares, or should care, is a different question. The question I'm asking today is not that, but rather: should we approach scientific investigations with a downstream implication in mind? This is a question I get a lot, and one that I ask myself quite often: what is the point of this particular line of research? If you work in the biological sciences, you probably know exactly what I'm talking about, and are no doubt well-versed in coming up with creative implications for your next grant, or perhaps your lab is established enough that you have a cookie-cutter template. In these cases, it's almost always linked to diseases: how a gene, protein, or biological process may impact our understanding of a debilitating disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is this at all controversial, you might ask? After all, it is pretty reasonable that when we apply for grants that we justify what possible good it does for society, especially when we're using tax money. Furthermore, engaging the public with what they care about - real life consequences - should only increase their support and interest in science. Ultimately, having some practical thoughts in mind about how your science might actually be useful is a good thing, right? Here, I would argue that searching and tacking on implications for a planned project much earlier than when we know what it could possibly imply has two serious negative consequences for science itself: the first social, the second scientific. I will situate both of these points in the context of neuroscientific research, but I believe they apply to biological research in general, though it seems that physical and computer science do not suffer as much from it (possibly a correlate of how much public money is dedicated to it).</p><p><strong>The reviewer knows the game, the public does not.</strong><br />It is important for the public to understand what science has meant for the world in the last 200 years or so, this is not really up for debate, because it is the truth. Almost every single artifact we interact with on a daily basis is the result of some scientific understanding of our world, manipulated and coaxed into being useful through engineering or clinical applications. The invisible fact that we live on average twice as long as we did a little over 100 years ago is also a product of science. But consider this: out of those discoveries that aid in extending our life, how many of them were thought to have such an implications when the projects were proposed? Furthermore, how many similar projects and discoveries did not ultimately contribute directly to this particular consequence, but could have very well be argued as such? For this, I turn to the classic example of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fluorescent_protein#Wild-type_GFP_.28wtGFP.29">green fluorescent protein</a> (GFP),&nbsp;because of how well it demonstrates the point and how absurdly and unimaginably different the discovery and the product are. GFP itself was discovered in the 60s, in a particular type of jellyfish that glows. Why someone was studying this thing, I really have no idea, though it's probably because they thought glowing jellyfish were fascinating (they are). You can, of course, find accounts of this discovery via a simple Google search, so I will not elaborate here. What I <strong>can</strong> tell you is that they did not study GFP because of its tremendous implications in biological sciences, and by extension, health sciences. It turns out, GFP and fluorescence microscopy are so ubiquitous in science these days that even first year undergrads get to play with it. Put your hand up if you honestly think you could've foreseen this coming in the 60s, I'd like to talk to you about investment strategies.</p><p>So why is this an issue for the public? Because selling something based on its potential implications that hit a soft spot in the heart of the general public, while not outrightly dishonest, does not generate good will, especially when they (almost always) fail to achieve the proposed implication. "But science is slow, and it takes patience!" you might say. True, though that is completely besides the point. After all, how many grant proposals, or interviews where a scientist talks about the potential impact of a discovery, actually state an estimated timeline where we will arrive at the projected implications, or even what the specific implication is? I read an article recently lamenting the poor return on investment of NIH money on neuroscience in the last decade or so, when it was hailed that such an injection of funding should push us forward in curing, or at least understanding,&nbsp;all kinds of mental and neurological disorders. How many of those have we cured or understood from beginning to end? If it's not zero, then it's definitely countable on one hand. From a scientific point of view, that is of course completely reasonable, if not expected. Science IS slow, and it DOES take patience. It's not a magic-circle where you can throw money in and get cures out. Over time, all the talk about implication this and implication that, while we under-deliver over and over again to the public, will and has eroded the public's perception of science. This is in part due to a lack of proper education about the scientific process itself, thus setting up an unrealistic expectation on what science delivers. Scientific research is not the same as industrial research, but it's starting to feel like it more and more, and scientists are not helping our own case when we suggest implications that we <strong>know</strong>&nbsp;are so far off in the future we might as well not state it. Alas, at the end of the day, it is something we are all guilty of, because it's part of the "game" to get funding and get published. Until the incentives change drastically, it may be the only way to keep doing science.&nbsp;It is simply recommended that, in the process of playing the game for our grant or paper reviewers, that we do not fool ourselves, nor the good people of the world into thinking that what we promised might actually be delivered in any reasonable amount of time. And it could serve us well to be plainly and painfully honest sometime to just say: "well, I can't really tell you what the implication is, and I don't really care if there is one. But rest assured that when we figure this thing out from top to bottom, someone somewhere WILL come up with something useful to do with it."</p><p><strong>Roadmaps limit imagination</strong><br />Working with future implications in mind is counter to the concept of science itself. What do I mean by that? Science, to me, is the undirected examination of a phenomenon or object in nature for the sole purpose of understanding it and satisfying a weird curiosity. Sure, this is just semantics, and what I personally think science is or ought to be really doesn't matter as long as it's productive.&nbsp;Therefore, I would further argue that goal-directed research, for the most part, stifles innovation by removing parallel thinking. Let's say our goal is to cure disease X, and methods A, B, and C are the most promising so far (at least they were published in Nature, Science, and Cell), why in the world would I try anything else if I, too, want to cure disease X, and also be the first? This is not to say that objective-oriented research isn't useful,&nbsp;it absolutely is. It's probably more <strong>useful</strong> than basic science research since that's what actually makes discoveries applicable. Even in basic science itself, goal-directed efforts, like the Allen Brain Institute, has achieved plenty in a very short amount of time.&nbsp;But the problem arises when we slowly and obliviously replace all of basic science research with engineering and industrial research, not in name but in essence, because soon enough, we won't have new discoveries to capitalize on. No one is explicitly doing this, which is what makes it all the more insidious - all it takes is to see where the money flows, and the money flows to projects with the best implications - see where I'm going with this?</p><p>So how do we combat this? Christof Koch spoke at UCSD recently about the Allen Brain Institute. Afterwards, I asked him what roles does he see academic research labs playing in the future, in light of the fact that the ABI was able to accomplish so much in so little time and with so little money (relatively speaking). His answer, while unsurprising, injected some hope in academic research. Basically, he said that university labs should keep doing what they do, which is exerting parallel efforts at problems so that we <strong>can</strong>&nbsp;still come up with new discoveries, like how DNA randomly evolves through recombination. I would append to that in this way: we should direct half the public money towards a few of these unified and industrialized efforts, like the ABI, because they will inevitably have something to show for it. The rest of the money should be divided up basically equally, to pay for academic labs and researchers to look at whatever the hell they want to look it. In fact, to really promote science in youth, we have to encourage students to pursue projects bounded only by their imagination and curiosity, and not by practical utility. My ideal vision for this is basically some form of universal basic income where researchers get paid a living (but oh god not minimum) wage to work on whatever problem they want to. I hear France has some kind of life-time personal funding like that. After all, working on interesting problems and getting rich and famous at it seems a bit like getting your cake and eating it too, which is exactly what doesn't make sense: academics making CEO money, or 20% of the labs getting 80% of the funding. I wonder what the actual statistics are on that...</p><p>Science is, for now, a public investment, just like infrastructure. And like infrastructure, it requires long-term vision and patience to really bare fruit. If we focus all of our energy and resources on projects that "have implications", it misses the most valuable part of science: utility through serendipitous discoveries. Again, I'm not saying we should scrap <strong>goals</strong>, or targeted investigations that follow a clear line of pre-established ideas. I am simply suggesting that we should re-evaluate whether we over-promise to the public for the sake of existing in this system, and whether that has subdued true scientific innovation. If so, instead of accommodating to the shitty system, maybe we can do something to change it?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>17/52: Climate of Complete Certainty</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/5/1/1752-climate-of-complete-certainty</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For week of April 24</p><p>The last 3 years have been an abrupt transition for me in terms of becoming aware of "politics". In particular, the political leaning of news media had always been a strange concept to me throughout even undergrad: aren't journalism and "news" suppose to be unbiased and fact-based? Since starting school in the U.S., however, I've become exposed - actually, probably over-exposed - to the politicization of media, mainly fueled by the contrasting coverage of stories like police shootings, immigration issues, and of course, the 2016 American election. Over time, it became an accepted fact to me that Fox News is simply not unbiased in its presentation of, well, anything. Frankly, neither is the New York Times, but one brand of politically-motivated messaging seems to me much more dangerous than the other. Regardless, I often wondered how it was that a network like Fox became to be known as the fox den (heh) of conservative agenda. After all, the channel seemed fairly normal in every other aspect (but mostly because of the Saturday morning cartoons on Fox Kids).&nbsp;</p><p>This week, though, I got the chance to observe firsthand how a news outlet could potentially start its transition into single-sided coverage, and it dawned on me that perhaps news outlets don't (entirely) choose to be biased one way or another - it is chosen by the people who consume them. I am, of course, referring to the whole New York Times debacle, where a "known climate change denier", Bret Stephens, wrote an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/opinion/climate-of-complete-certainty.html">op-ed article</a>&nbsp;that triggered a swath of readers to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/bret-stephens-new-york-times-climate-change-article-subscriptions-canceled-op-ed-2017-4">cancel their NYT subscription</a>. In particular, it seemed like it was left-leaning, science-loving folks who jumped ship on NYT, a newspaper that, to my knowledge, has been a <strong>relatively</strong>&nbsp;unbiased news outlet. On the one hand, it made perfect sense: consumers, whether liberal- or conservative-leaning, has the right to choose how they spend their money. It is through this choice of how we spend our money that subtly shifts the market-based world around us - "voting with our cash". If casually picking up your Sunday morning read gives you high-blood pressure, why bother? At the same time, though, it made me realize this: this whole controversy generated enough of a discussion that NYT probably thought hard about what its position is on climate change, and on the politically-motivated discussion thereafter. But if enough liberals cancel their subscription, the next time a pseudo-scientist or climate-change denier pens an op-ed, less people will be outraged. Over time, maybe NYT will degenerate into Fox news? In other words, NYT will turn into Fox news when reasonable and educated people stop reading the NYT.&nbsp;Again, this is not a criticism towards the people that canceled their subscriptions, especially if you see a better organization that supports your views. Also, this is not really relevant but I just want to make a note to say that I doubt this is how Fox news came to its current sad state. In any case, I followed this development with a lot of passive curiosity: why are people so angry, and how are people's actions going to change the future of NYT as well as the debate on climate change?</p><p>Honestly, I probably know as much about climate change as a high school senior knows "mathematics". Nevertheless, I, first and foremost, trust in the scientific process that generated the results and predictions about human-caused climate change. I don't have an understanding of the complex models that were applied to get at these inferences, but I trust that the climate science community did their due diligence (in ways, for example, that the psychological sciences community was recently shown to have not throughout the replication crisis). Furthermore, when someone - ANYONE -&nbsp;tells me "if you don't slow down the car, there's a 90% probability that you will crash into the next tree and die", I will PROBABLY slow down, much more so if the person telling me this was my driving instructor. These two things form my belief on supporting science-based policy changes with regards to environmental protection and alternative energy, but I would not tell anyone that the scientific predictions were 100% for certain going to happen, that's just not how science works. Based on this last caveat, my first read-through of the NYT op-ed was of mild disinterest: aside from the terrible Hilary Clinton analogy, which many people have pointed out to be a logical fallacy and clearly a dirty trick, what this man was saying did not seem as unreasonable as I thought it would be when I first heard of the debacle on Twitter. After reading through a few responses to it (<a target="_blank" href="https://thinkprogress.org/the-ny-times-promised-to-fact-check-their-new-climate-denier-columnist-they-lied-72ad9bdf6019">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="#">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://kencaldeira.wordpress.com/2017/04/29/climate-of-risk-and-uncertainty/">here</a>, and I really like this <a target="_blank" href="http://philosoraptor.blogspot.ca/2017/04/climate-of-complete-certainty-or-nice.html">one</a>), I understand the outrage a bit better. It wasn't so much what he was saying in the article, as opposed to what he was NOT saying. The entire piece is structured as a reasonable and amicable call for further discussion on the matter. After all, the fact that science is not 100% Truth and Certainty is nothing new. However, by omitting the danger of inaction, as well as the relatively strong degree of certainty in the information we DO have, it invisibly undercuts the scientific credibility of the argument. One of the responses above framed it as a "dog-whistle" to the mass populace of climate change deniers, a term that I find both hilarious and accurate. Furthermore, when considering the context of the author Stephen Brit's apparent history of denying climate change and other policies largely embraced by the left, I can see how this op-ed can be equated to demonic chants in writing. Again, I think this is a case of me being too literal and not seeing the context, implications, and reading between the lines. Had he truly wanted to bring the two sides together, it would've been very easy to add a sentence or two stating the relative certainty we have about climate change and the dangers of inaction, if nothing else than to throw liberals a bone. As it stands, though, this does read like a thinly-veiled attack on the facts we have gathered about climate change. But to be honest, I can also see how this could sound fairly reasonable to a person naive to the whole situation, like myself. In any case, I'm curious to see how NYT responds to this onslaught of criticism and how it frames future op-eds on sensitive issues.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>16/52: March for Science?</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/5/1/1652-march-for-science</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For week of April 17 (Thumbnail photo <a target="_blank" href="https://www.good.is/slideshows/20-best-march-for-science-signs#13">source</a>)</p><p>I went to the science march in San Diego last Saturday, and I’m still confused as to how I feel about it. Let me be clear: I'm in no way criticizing the march or the people that participated in it, it's simply a thought-exercise for myself to get some clarity.&nbsp;</p><p>When I first heard that this event was being organized in DC, and subsequently all around the world, I immediately felt like it was my duty to participate. Afterall, it’s about science, which is literally my livelihood. Independent of that, I support the existence of science (obviously). But this sense of obligation was not matched by a feeling of passion or any really emotion at all, and for the weeks leading up to it, I sometimes wondered what the point of it was. In a way, this march felt similar to most of the recent ones since the new commander-in-cheetoh came to office, in that I wasn’t sure what specific demands were being made, or how we proposed to change it. The one thing that made the science march different, though, was that no clear group of people was being treated inappropriately. When the muslim ban happened, protests felt like standing in solidarity with our friends and colleagues, and the same goes for the women’s march. But marching for science seemed, to be frank, a bit comical. Yes, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/16/14940444/2018-budget-trump-science-nih">funding for science is being slashed</a>, in ways both directly (NIH) and indirectly (EPA, NASA)&nbsp;relevant to me personally.&nbsp;On top of that, I’m well aware of the anti-science, anti-fact rhetoric from the current administration and an increasing proportion of the population at large. At the same time, though, we were clearly not marching for the few government funded agency that got hit with job losses. No, we were marching for the existence of science in this world,&nbsp;its value in our current society, and the potential impact this anti-science sentiment will potentially have for our future. For whatever reason, this seemed like an absurd notion, because science plays a role in literally everything we interact with on a daily basis: cars, roads, food, deoderant, you name it. Anybody with any sense should realize this, and if you don’t, then I’m not sure the march will do anything for you. In short, the population, at least in my mind, is so clearly divided that there are people who believe in the value of science and its mission to find the truth, and there are people who don’t - what a time to be alive. For a while, I reasoned that this absurdity - the fact that the validity of scientific investigations is even up for debate - is the exact reason why we have to march, but that doesn't seem to be accomplishing much more than...people who think science is important walking together to talk about how important science is.&nbsp;But maybe I'm wrong here. Maybe there are people on the fence about whether science is a good thing, especially kids growing up in cities that may not be as science-privileged as San Diego and other major metropolitan areas. I'd be interested to see what non-believers thought of the march, because these are the people whose opinions we seek to change. Tangentially, my confusion of how I felt was further compounded by my fear of having this discussion in any candid way with people around me. It is clearly a very sensitive issue, and I felt like any attempt to discuss this in an inward-looking way may come off as unfairly critical. In fact, it feels like doing anything other than throwing your full weight behind the march in support felt like a betrayal, because doing nothing at this point is guilty of upholding the status quo. In any case, if anyone had similar conflicts of thoughts for why they marched (or didn't march), I'd love to hear about how you have (or haven't) resolved that, because I still don't really have an answer. But perhaps, at the end of the day, it is simply exercising our rights to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/im-marching-fight-alarming-war-science-join/">civil engagement</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>15/52: Language: beetles, Bruce Lee, &amp; All the Light We Cannot See</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/4/17/1552-language-beetles-bruce-lee-all-the-light-we-cannot-see</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Language is often thought of as the pinnacle of human intelligence. It let's us communicate with each other unreasonably effectively on a day to day basis. Well, more effectively than just pointing and grunting. But recently, I've been finding myself becoming more and more unsatisfied with language, in two different ways.</p><p>First, it is the ambiguity of language used in cognitive science and neuroscience, especially with terms having to do with mental processes, such as "memory". I raised this annoyance about cognitive science a few weeks ago, and part of the problem is obviously the immaturity of the field as a whole. In other words, we don't have good definitions locked down because we haven't figured out what memory is. But the other problem stems from language itself, I think, or the subjectivity of language. Many expositions and thought experiments have discussed this issue at length, for example, the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_language_argument">Wittgenstein's beetle experiment</a>. In essence, when language is used to discuss something that is purely rooted in the mental realm, i.e., our individual experiences of our own mental processes, we can never be certain that we're talking about the same thing. In most circumstances, the concept represented by a word in the language is rooted in a physical, existing entity, like an apple. We can have a philosophical discussion about whether apple truly exists, either the physical entity or the concept, but I think it's not too controversial to say that apple is more of an existing physical entity than a cognitive process like "attention". So the question here is, because we each experience "attention" differently, just as we experience "red", can we ever pin down a definition for it? "Redness" is a purely made up concept, but it has enough of a physical representation that we can all point to and just agree on the fact that it is red. "Attention", however, is something that all of us experience in our daily lives, but cannot ever point to in the external world. We can talk about a specific experience in detail and use that as an example of attention, and we can certainly conduct psychophysics studies that objectively measure a specific aspect of human behavior which we then can agree to call "attention", but our study of it can never catch up to our ever-evolving experience. A good example of that is "language" itself. What is language? We have formally studied language for quite a long time, but our daily experiences with it have evolved to quite a different thing. Are emojis language? Are they a part of A language, or are they a language of their own? And if (or when) the formal study of language has accepted Emojism as a proper sub-discipline, new ones will have evolved. Hence, does it ever make sense to study something that is inherently ever-changing? Does that mean that cognitive science then, as a whole, is futile?&nbsp;Because the goal is to understand human cognition but you can't scientifically study something that you can't define, and you certainly can't define something if it's constantly evolving.</p><hr /><p>My second issue with language is not with language itself, per se, but my own command of it. There is an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2clpHtV1iA">interview</a> of Bruce Lee talking about how to express oneself honestly through martial arts, that I always come back to, because I think this authenticity is transferable to many other aspect of our lives. Long story short, the difficulty of mastering a skill, whatever it is, lies in aligning your mental and physical self, such that you're able to express, honestly and accurately, what you've envisioned (let's set aside for now my distaste for a mental representation). In martial arts, it might be the envisioning of a specific sequence of movements. In music, it is the same, but with the outcome of sounds that express the desired emotion. In language, it is a lot more literal -&nbsp;to communicate, through words, one's true thoughts and feelings. It's an easy problem at first glance, because words are defined in the dictionary, and we simply have to construct speech with the blueprint of our thoughts the meaning we want to convey. But in practice, it is of course a lot more messy that that, because words don't mean the same for everyone, and in that sense, using the correct set of words is not the true objective, but rather to convey the experience that we want to convey such that the person listening can understand. The speaker can clearly expect certain baseline commonality in the way the two of them understand words, if they speak the same language. But ultimately, how does the speaker choose to convey meaning if their words are not grounded by the same experiences or mental representations as the listener? Vocabulary is a superficial, but, to a degree,&nbsp;sufficient solution for this problem. Learning new words means you can use more precise language to describe very specific thoughts. I don't speak German, but that language seems like a pretty good example of this, where you can find really long words that describe very specific things. English, on the other hand, is rather poor in this <a target="_blank" href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/50698/38-wonderful-foreign-words-we-could-use-english">regard</a>. Still, these words depend on common understanding (or shared context), and using superfluous words might actually hinder understanding.</p><p>I came to realize my own poor grasp of language through a simultaneous process of reading and speaking. I recently finished the novel "All the Light We Cannot See", and it is, in my limited literary experience, a truly wonderful piece of writing. The first half of the story is rather mundane, but the author writes it with such sublime detail that, for the first time, reading for the sake of reading, and not for the plot line, gave me joy. Several passages live vividly in my mind, I will describe just one. Our young protagonist is a blind French girl who lived with her father in Paris at the start of World War 2. She's just learned Braille a few years ago and is furiously devouring literary classics through her fingertips. On this particular day, however, the German invasion of Paris has begun and her father was summoned to attend to museum business, and she anxiously awaits his return:</p><p><em>"Marie-Laure sits cross-legged on the floor of the key pound and tries to read her novel. Captain Nemo is about to take Professor Aronnax and his companions on an underwater stroll through oyster beds to hunt for pearls, but Aronnax is afraid of the prospect of sharks, and though she longs to know what will happen, the sentences disintegrate across the page. Words devolve into letters, letters into unintelligible bumps. She feels as if big mitts have been drawn over each hand."</em></p><p>You know that feeling you get when you cannot focus on reading something and you keep going back to the sentence over and over again, each time as if the words disappear into a puff of smoke? I felt like that last passage was the first time I've ever been able to truly describe that feeling adequately in words, and it is from a description of a girl who reads with her fingers. And, from that, I felt like I was able to immediately relate to how she felt, even though the way we read cannot be more different. Contrary to what I said above (my first issue), something was able to link these two completely orthogonal and disparate experiences. Of course, I will never know what she was truly feeling, or what the author truly intended to convey, but through this passage, I think I was able to experience for the first time the exquisite power of a literary device. Having experienced how precisely one can describe/invoke an experience with simple, common words, I realized how poorly I take advantage of this in my everyday speech and writing. Part of the problem is that I am really quite literal, so I often feel bound by the "right" definition of words and phrases, to the point that semantic accuracy supersedes imagination, which is unsurprising given my affinity for math and programming. A great example of this is when I struggle to use phrases that I don't understand the social context for, like "I'm sorry". To me, "I'm sorry" means I regret and apologize for the mistake or inconvenience that I personally have caused, and only that. But over a very long period of time, I've learned that you're also suppose to say "I'm sorry" to someone when something unfortunate has happened to them, like the death and illness of a friend or family member. This perplexes me to no end, because I didn't understand how you can be sorry for something that has nothing to do with you. On Merriam-Webster, it actually says it's an expression of sorrow or regret, so it includes the feeling of sadness I feel when something unfortunate happens to someone I care about. But which is it? Sorrow and regret are completely different things, unless I also misunderstand "regret". The point is, my new-found awareness of my inadequate command of language feels like if I was trying to practice martial arts underwater - the body does not go where the mind wishes.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>14/52: The life of a TA</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/4/9/1452-the-life-of-a-ta</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting this week, it will be my 6th time being a teaching assistant. Boy, it felt like it was just yesterday that I myself was an undergrad sitting in a tutorial/discussion section, all green-horned and not having a single clue that the TA up there is probably a sleep-deprived graduate student who also probably didn't have a say in the particular class they were teaching. Had I known what I know now, having been in the shoes of a TA, I would've given myself some advice that definitely could have made life easier and made learning more fun. So that's why I will share it here, in case anybody reading is still IN undergrad, or know somebody that does.</p><p>tl;dr: The advice, essentially, comes down to twos thing: 1) TAs (almost always) want to help, but please, help me help you, and 2) don't be an asshole, TAs are humans too. I know, groundbreaking right?&nbsp;Some might even say that professors are also humans, but that's more of a case-by-case thing.</p><p>Also, I was flipping through my TA reviews to prepare for this upcoming quarter, so I thought I might share some of the hilarious tips for improvement (but padded with the good reviews too, in case anyone reading this might give me a job later). Click on the image to see the full comments. (Cover photo credit to Jorge Cham of PHD Comic.)</p><hr /><p><strong>Praxis 1 - Intro to Engineering Design</strong><br />This was my very first time TAing, and it was when I myself was still in the final year of my undergrad. For those of you that aren't in on the EngSci scoops, Praxis 1 is one of the most controversial and polarizing courses of the entire Engineering Science curriculum. I still maintain that it is one of the most useful classes I've taken, because it emphasized presentation and communication of ideas as an essential part of engineering, not just applied math and sciences. But some people just hated it, because they got into engineering thinking it would be fair and objective, and essentially had to take this essay-writing BS class in the very first semester.&nbsp;Clearly I'm biased because I liked it enough to TA for it, but it was also good money as an undergrad barely making it on my own. Anyway, getting the insider scoop on how Praxis was run gave me clarity on life, for the first time, as a post-secondary educator: <strong>no matter who it is and what profession they are in, the majority of people are JUST barely keeping their shit together (myself included), and that's not a knock on anybody.</strong> You think students hand in assignments last minute? Well, TAs and profs also make up and grade assignments last minute. In hindsight, this was probably one of the most organized classes, because there was an especially strong focus on pedagogy, and it was the main priority for most of the people involved, which cannot be said for most research professors. In any case, this class had such a profound effect on me that it's partially the reason that I still have a blog today. All students were required to have a blog in first year, which led me to continue with writing online throughout undergrad, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://d9h0st.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/reflection-studio-1w-sept-11-13/">when I was a TA</a>. This class was really unique because design studios were not the same as lectures, <strong>but honestly -&nbsp;and this applies to all classes -&nbsp;all you gotta do is act like this shit is kinda interesting, and your TA will go out of their way to HELP YOU succeed.</strong>&nbsp;I don't have any funny TA reviews to share for this class, because I never got them, and to this day I still think to myself that I might have been fired because I was doing such a poor job, and Jason Foster spared me the misery and instead told me a grad student had to be hired due to "union reasons".</p><hr /><p><strong>COGS1 - Intro to Cognitive Science</strong><br />This was my first TA assignment in graduate school, second quarter of first year. It was also just 4 months after we first asked ourselves, in our own graduate class, "what is cognitive science?" To this day, I still don't know (refer to last week's post), but I obviously couldn't let the poor students know that.&nbsp;The problem was further compounded by my belief then that neuroscience is the only real science here, but again, I couldn't let the students know that. I usually tell the class that I TA, that I am here to learn from you as much as you are to learn from me, and it cannot be more true here.&nbsp;Aside from the material, this class was basically your vanilla first year class, the CogSci equivalent of first year biology: large lectures with multiple choice quizzes and exams. <strong>The road to success on a multiple choice exam is simple: go to the review session, and preferably with questions.</strong> If you don't have questions, go with a friend that does. Think about it: why the hell would your TA volunteer like an extra hour of life to hold an exam review session just so they can be more unhelpful than they usually are? Does this make any sense? No. I don't know about other departments, but I and almost everybody I know basically run review sessions by giving out a subset of the exam questions that will be covered for sure, especially the confusing ones, which means if you paid attention throughout the whole session, and even if you forget a few things, you're guaranteed like a 80%. The only exception to this is when the class is known to weed-out students, in which case the prof might aim for a 60% average. Even then, knowing what your TA knows will help you stay on the right side of the bell curve.</p>

<p>"Get everything together." Only if getting my life together is that simple. Also, "when no one has any questions assume that they don't know and review the question anyway." If you are this kind of person: fuck you. If you have hands, you can raise them, god gave you motor function precisely so you don't have to hold other people accountable for your idiotic actions, and that's AFTER being probed many, many times about questions.&nbsp;<strong>Another key to success: if you have a question, ASK IT.</strong>&nbsp;Also, as you can clearly see, I have no knowledge of anything outside my little corner of the CogSci hexagon at that time. I might argue I still don't, but I can pretend better now. Which brings me to...</p><hr /><p><strong>COGS1 - Intro to Cognitive Science (again)</strong><br />Two years later, I got assigned to TA for the same class, except this time, enrollment was in the 400s. This huge class seriously made me (once again) doubt the effectiveness of large post-secondary institutions, because as well-intending and caring as the TAs and instructors try to be, managing 400 people is simply not the same as managing 100 people 4 times. Or maybe it is, but it just feels exponentially more difficult. By the end of the 10 weeks, I learned something about prepping for big classes like these: <strong>don't do anything at the beginning that will make you hate yourself at the end</strong>. In a small class, it's fun to be more flexible because you can go with the flow of the class, see what they engage in and what they don't, and any additional work spawned from spontaneity isn't all that bad. With 400 people, it's a different story. Even the most airtight syllabus will inevitably prompt questions from the students, especially pertaining to grades, so it is my recommendation for planning large classes that all grades, down to the percent, are set in actionable terms on the syllabus from day 1, because it is not a fun weekend getting 10+ emails from students asking about how they can earn these ambiguously-defined 2% of participation marks.</p><p>Conversely, if you're a student in a large class like this, I tend to put you in one of three categories: "under-the-radar", "grade-hound", or "seems-interested". Under the radar means I have no clue what your name is, but can probably recognize your face. Not the best, but if you know your material, it's fine, we don't ever have to cross paths. A grade hound is the person that will not engage in any other aspect of the class with the TA or instructor EXCEPT to show up with a graded assignment to ask "why did I not get marks for ______?" It's not even that showing up to ask for clarification is so offensive or anything, but if your TA senses that you have no interest in understanding why it was wrong in the first place, and just want to argue, then they're not going to want to help you. On the other hand, if you seem interested, e.g. ask a question in section once in a while, then when the time comes that you ask me why you didn't get marks for whatever, I will assume that you want a better grasp of the material, and furthermore, be more willing to see from your perspective why you thought your way. This seems very non-objective and unfair, but <strong>this is a fact of life: life is not just black and white, relationships with people matter, and NOBODY can be objective grading an essay response.</strong> Obviously I'm not looking for students to give them free marks, but if something fell in the grey area, I WILL be more inclined to assume what you wrote is a shorthand for the actual answer, especially if we've talked about it before in person. Simple. I want to help every single person get good grades in the classes I teach, but please,&nbsp;<strong>help me help yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>Alright, I took shortcuts on slides for this quarter, it's true, I admit it. But I will not give up my policy of letting you teach yourselves, I just won't. I don't get paid enough for this shit, and there are 50 of you in section, somebody has to know the answer, right? But no seriously, I always try to get students to answer each other's questions, and have them disagree with each other, because more people might remember it. Perhaps I need to refine my waiting technique, maybe do a little dance or play the Jeopardy music while I wait...</p><hr /><p><strong>COGS14B - Intro to Stats</strong><br />Not much to say here that I haven't already covered above: go to office hour, go to exam review, those help.&nbsp;Intro level math classes are difficult to teach, because it's usually a requirement, so students are there against their will, which means there is a large distribution of skill and interest levels. Some people will fall asleep because they did this shit in high school, and some people will fall asleep because they're so far behind it doesn't event matter anymore. As a TA, the material itself is easy but teaching it in an intuitive way is not. Honestly, teaching this class helped me understand simple stats concepts so much better than when I took the class myself in undergrad. I have more photos of people sleeping in that class than I have pages of my own notes, probably.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like I said, you can't please everybody in an intro math class.</p><hr /><p><strong>COGS118B - Machine Learning</strong><br />For whatever reason, I got pegged to TA for machine learning, which, even though I have a background and have taken ML classes in undergrad,&nbsp;is so far out of my area of expertise that some of the students in this class probably can teach me (one actually did school me in linear algebra, on one occasion). These two comments basically sum up my experience:</p>

<hr /><p>That's all, folks. If you're reading this, you're probably a friend of mine, which means you probably won't ever get to use these advice for undergrad again, but maybe your younger sibling/cousin/kids might. The point is, most TAs I know try to be helpful, so if you need help, go to them, be it during office hours or exam reviews. No need to bring chocolate or be a teacher's pet or anything like that, just be respectful in the way you'd be to another human being, and be interested in doing well.&nbsp;In my own experience as an undergrad, I was usually just so behind on coursework that there was no point going to office hour because I'd have nothing to say. I still remember this one time, during like the 4th tutorial section of the ML class I took in undergrad, the TA was talking about some complicated shit like SVMs or something, and one guy strolls in, sits down, raises his hand, and says "can you explain linear regression again?" You don't want to be THAT guy, either.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>13/52: Do we need a (better) functional description of the brain?</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/3/5/1352-what-even-is-cogsci</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every two weeks or so, I am faced with the innocent but extremely daunting question of "so, what do you study?" This almost always happens in an Uber/Lyft ride, and I now have a routine that I go through before carrying forward with this conversation. The routine consists of thinking for half a second whether I really want to tell this person that I study Cognitive Science, and then inevitably deciding to tell them that I study neuroscience. 9 out of 10 times, bless their hearts, they will respond with: "so you're going to be a neurosurgeon?" And I will proceed to tell them, no, you have to be a real doctor to do that.</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1762.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/58e1a082e6f2e17ea4c55778/1491181971125/Screen+Shot+2017-04-02+at+6.06.50+PM.png.50+PM.png?format=original" alt="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~nunez/COGS260_S17/Syllabus260_S17.htm"/> http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~nunez/COGS260_S17/Syllabus260_S17.htm[/caption]


<p>But why do I tell my Uber drivers that I study neuroscience? Well, in part,&nbsp;because it's true. My day to day activities involve almost solely of trying to understand the structure and dynamics of the biological brain. But on the other hand, I tell them that because if they were to ask what cognitive science is, I would have no clue what to tell them.&nbsp;This is not because I'm a terrible student.&nbsp;Consider this: one of the most asked question within cognitive science, in my 3 years of experience being in graduate school, is "what is cognitive science?" We were asked this question during our first day of class, and we still ask ourselves this question on a weekly basis. Still not convinced? The image above is from the website of a course a professor is putting together for the new quarter, that I literally just got an email for.&nbsp;I don't know if other fields of research are similarly introspective, but I also don't know any other field that is as interdisciplinary as cognitive science. Whether cognitive science, as it exists today, is interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary is up for debate, but the fact is that you often have a room of professional academics that research wildly different things. This is particularly true in the CogSci department at UCSD, but a look at last year's <a href="https://mindmodeling.org//cogsci2016/">proceedings</a> from the Annual Meeting of Cognitive Science Society - an international gathering - reveals similar sentiments: lacking a better word to describe it, the collection of these papers seems pretty <strong>random</strong>. This rich multidisciplinarity, though, is not the cause for the lack of identity, but another consequence.</p><p><strong>A mind split</strong><br />Digging a bit deeper, you will recover a theme in that collection. Cognitive science, to be sure, had its glorious days. About 30 years ago, CogSci gave birth to some truly avant-garde work in psychology, neuroscience, and as many will know, artificial intelligence, specifically in the form of artificial neural networks. In a way, CogSci was just as blended as it is now, but for whatever reason, in the 30 years that span the creation of the department at UCSD and today,&nbsp;it has lost any semblance of a coherent identity. The reason for that, I believe, is the discretization of the different aspects of the "mind", or cognition. Ultimately, if you ask a cognitive science to give a single and definitive answer as to what cognitive scientists study, it would probably center around the study of the mind, within their specialized context, like learning, social interaction, or spatial navigation. Some might say it's the study of "intelligent systems", but pushed hard enough, intelligence is ultimately measured in a mind-like way. You probably wouldn't get this answer unless you put a gun to their heads, though, because "mind"&nbsp;is a fluid concept that is intuitive but very hard to define scientifically.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, 30 years ago, a hodgepodge of smart people getting together to study the mind works because the specific details haven't been mapped out yet. Our understanding of the brain, as well as other intelligent systems,&nbsp;was poor, and creating a computer program that mimics some aspect of human behavior meant you were getting somewhere in figuring out the mind. It was the corollary to the idiom: what I cannot create, I do not understand - what we can create together, we might understand.&nbsp;Fast forward to 30 years later, I think our understanding of the different - <strong>physical</strong> - components of the "mind" is too detailed for abstract conversations across different perspectives of looking at the mind.&nbsp;At the same time, it is not yet detailed enough, largely speaking, to support an actual rigorous scientific discussion linking one field to another. Neurons in the brain are not the same as neurons in a deep network, they just aren't. This exposes a fundamental problem in the way we have been looking at cognition, and it's that "cognition", in its essence,&nbsp;is a functional metaphor that we have been using interchangeably to describe different natural phenomena, which is losing steam in the face of better and more faithful metaphors - scientific models - of these different systems.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cognition as a metaphor</strong><br />One of the most fascinating things I've learned in my 3 years here is how completely different physical systems can exhibit similar intelligent behavior. For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkVhLJLG7ug">slime mold</a> is a kind of amoeba-like organism that, as a group, can solve some very difficult geometrical problems. On a bigger scale, cells in our own bodies organize together to form very intricate systems, like the brain, that enable us humans to become pretty smart. And at the biggest scale, societies are made up of millions of individual persons that also, somehow, give rise to behaviors that are way more complex than the linear combination of their constituents, phenomena like cultural norms and macroeconomics. In a particular department of cognitive science, you might find professors that study each of those things, and rightfully so, because they all study some mind-like, intelligent phenomenon that ultimately seems orderly but is difficult to characterize. Even more incredibly, the mathematics and other tools they each use can be identical, tools like dynamical systems, graph and network theory, etc. However -&nbsp;and I'm sure I will look back on this in 3 years or so and feel stupid - I think there are a few pressing issues we need to address before acting as if everybody has a common goal.</p><p>Currently, my personal opinion is that cognition is a functional metaphor that we, humans, have imposed on natural systems all around us, kind of like an anthropomorphization of purely physical things. At the core of it, it's rooted in our own consciousness and belief that we have an intelligent mind, and our current understanding of the human brain fuels the belief that the brain functionally gives rise to the mind - which is a <strong>functional</strong> account of the brain. Of course, that's not strictly false, because taking away the brain will obviously also take away our ability to perform certain behaviors, like seeing, reaching, and scrolling through Facebook. But at the same time, it's a metaphor in the sense that the physical behavior we are able to produce is a natural, physical consequence of something the brain is doing, not a functional consequence. I find this concept to be most easily distinguished via perception and action, and most confused when thinking about "thinking". For example, muscles in your arm are innervated by neurons in your spinal cord, which are in turn connected to motor neurons that reach down from your brain. It is therefore not very difficult to think of the whole chain as a purely physical system: neurons in the brain fire,&nbsp;arm moves. Not that the problem of how your brain makes that happen in such a precise way is not extremely difficult, the point is that we can think about this whole sequence of events just by tracing the ions that pass through layers and layers of cell membranes, bypassing any need for "cognition". The problem arises, though, when we want to talk about WHY you decided to move your arm in such a way. There, we are stuck with an extra layer of metaphor: the brain gave rise to the computation required to initiate this volitional movement. And if we're not careful, we would conclude that that's the brain's function! This seems both extremely intuitive but also extremely absurd.&nbsp;After all, we would never say the function of electrons is to pass charges from the battery to your phone screen! No, we simply describe electrons for what they are in the entangled physical system that is your phone.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the right metaphor, then?</strong><br />To be sure, an "electron" is also a metaphor. It's a scientific model of a phenomenon that is able to consistently describe, and more importantly, predict, things that have happened in the past and things that will happen in the future. These metaphors are updated constantly when we discover new facts about the world through scientific experiments. In that sense, neuroscience (cognitive neuroscience aside) is an attempt to describe the brain with these kinds of purely physical metaphors: ions, membranes, circuits. We can, and I think we should, attempt to describe the nervous system as completely as possible at this purely physical level, through metaphors that describe its structure and dynamics. This doesn't mean we should not care about behavior. In fact, we can easily combine this physical system with those for which we already have working, descriptive metaphors. Really, we've been doing this for organs in our body for a long time, by studying their anatomy and dynamics, like the lungs and the heart. But for whatever reason, we feel that there is more to the brain. Again, personal opinion, but I would say this is probably the disastrous result of the rushed marriage between psychology and neurology: we've always wanted to understand ourselves more, from a philosophical perspective, through the study of psychology, and we accidentally stumbled upon the fact that people missing parts of their brain also have psychological abnormalities, so why not put two and two together, nevermind the possibly uncrossable chasm between these two metaphors?</p><p>So what good is the metaphor of the mind, scientifically? For some, it is an useful abstraction that generalizes over a set of similar phenomenon. For example, "memory" is a shorthand for whenever we are able to recall a previous experience, be it what color shirt you wore on Tuesday, how your lunch smelled, or how ecstatic you felt after passing your exam. Judging by the current state of things, I don't know whether these abstractions are more useful or more hurtful for scientific progress, at least in neuroscience. Because of the vague, non-descriptiveness of "memory" as a metaphor, we've had to come up with more discrete versions, like visual memory, auditory memory, affective memory, working memory, short term memory, long term memory, episodic memory, procedural memory, and the list goes on. But then why not study the brain as a purely physical system coupled to the rest of your body? After all, it would have tremendous practical utility in clinical applications, like for treating those with neurological and psychiatric disorders. My speculation is that using words like these allows us to tie the science of cognition back to our daily experiences, which is ultimately what we're interested in. Some people are truly fascinated by how a specific ion channel contributes to the dynamic of a nerve cell, to which I say:&nbsp;"good for you, we need more people like you." But I would say most people interested in cognition - scientists and the general public -&nbsp;are those that are in it for the philosophical reason, that perhaps by characterizing it scientifically, it would give our experiences regularity and meaning, rhyme and reason for their existence. In fact, I would say that the current infatuation that society at large has with neuroscience is really a misplaced fascination in psychology. Not that there's anything wrong with that, people care about things that are relevant for them, and neuroscience can contribute to that in two ways: understanding brain diseases, and understanding our daily mental experiences. Except, now I'm not so convinced that it can ever do the latter.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 26, 2017</p><p>Obviously, spoiler alert. If you haven't seen Get Out and are intending to see it, stop reading. If you have (or don't plan on doing so), do continue and let me know if you took away any of your own metaphors.</p><p><strong>tldr:</strong> watched a horror movie;&nbsp;shattered my sense of identity; can't imagine the shit black people have to deal with; I will start wearing a metaphorical tinfoil hat from now on.</p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/58d8b577ebbd1aac6207ae6b/1490597253848/jordan-peele.jpg" alt=""/>


<hr /><p>I don't usually watch horror films, and when I do, I almost never get creeped out the way they are intended to creep you out. Of course, something suddenly popping out of the screen gets a nice squirt of adrenaline into my veins, but afterwards, I never think twice about the movie. I think this is because I'm a very literal person, and for a horror film to take hold of you after you go home and make you run up the basement stairs after the lights go off, you have to buy into the metaphor. Usually, the metaphors themselves are very literal: a supernatural being is hiding in the dark; a serial murderer is looking for you; fate has marked your preeminent and violent death. I was baptized in the church of physics, so ghosts and grungy girls groping me through my television are more laughable than gruesome; and to not die at the hands of a serial murderer, just follow your common sense, run the hell out of there, and don't trip. In short, either I haven't watched a lot of quality horror films (I haven't), or they're just not my thing -&nbsp;which was why this movie gave me extra creeps.</p><p>To be honest, throughout the film, I thought it was just okay: there were good comedic moments, and the horror/racial tropes were cringeworthy enough to be enjoyable. But as a whole, my literalness fixated on the horror being conducted on screen, namely, white people displacing the souls of black people and taking over their bodies as their own. Neither the hypnosis nor the neurosurgery made a drop of sense, and so the whole plot was reduced to a complicated and farcical story to string together an array of racial jokes, as a way to flip off well-intending and fully racist white folks alike. Don't get me wrong, none of that is a bad thing. I can fully get behind ironic and comedic exposure to the ways minorities are mistreated, but I suppose I was unsatisfied because the film wasn't any more than watching a bunch of Key and Peele sketches in one sitting, which, again, while enjoyable, maybe doesn't deserve its outstanding Rotten Tomato ratings. As Chris is saved by his goofy friend, my relief for our protagonist is mixed with confusion and disappointed. Had I just not gotten why everyone loved it so much? Maybe I was aware enough of the ways black people are (mis)treated to be mildly entertained as oppose to enlightened? But as the last 10 seconds of the film unfolded, as said goofy friend backed the car out, the screen fixated on Chris' face: it wasn't a face of relief, knowing that he had been saved from the final horror. It was a face of horror itself, of confusion and uncertainty. And somewhere in that last 10 seconds, it suddenly hit me like a punch in the face, time stopped and I was suddenly hyper-aware of me and my surroundings as the lights cut on. I think I got it. Or my version of "it", whatever it is.</p><hr /><p>My family moved from China to our current home of Toronto, Canada in 2002, when I was a young Chinese boy 11 years of age. Somehow, we stumbled into an upper-middle class neighborhood around Sheppard and Bayview. (If you don't know what that's like: we had an upscale mall with no McDonalds but an A&amp;W.) Of course, we had close to no money (or so I believe, since they never bought me those goddamn YuGiOh cards), and lived with another Chinese family in an apartment suite meant for one small family. The adults took up the two bedrooms, which in my memory was really only big enough for a bed, which I had to sit on to use the desk because there was no room for an extra chair. The two boys - me and the other family's son a year older than me - bunked in the living room. Not as a den-turned-bedroom thing that people living in downtown condos do now, but just two beds in the living room next to the TV. We had become familiar with two other Chinese families in the apartment complex and that, along with our roommate family, was my parents' closest acquaintances for those couple of years. I write all of this not as a sob story demonstrating how poor and unprivileged we are, but to say that I had absolutely no clue any of this was abnormal in any way. Later on in life I would learn that this is actually a common experience for Asian technology-immigrant (as opposed to investment) families, but that was not what made the situation normal for me. For me,&nbsp;it was normal because I was at an age trying to normalize absolutely everything I could around me.&nbsp;</p><p>There are, however, more foreign things that I've normalized and normalized myself into that I never fully consciously chose. The natural consequence of living in an upper-middle class neighborhood in Canada was that I lived around and went to school with predominantly white people. Not hipsters or hippies, and as far as I can tell, not Canadian rednecks. Just regular, normal white families in faux-suburbia. I still don't fully understand the struggle to fit into an entirely different world as a budding teenager or an immigrant, but I imagine it was pretty confusing, and I was trying to soak up as much white culture as I could. For whatever reason, I realized that to be accepted in this new social hierarchy, I had to disassociate myself from friends that are "too Asian" as well as not act like such myself. There were, of course, Asian people in the community, but only the westernized Asians had any luck in being integrated into the vicious world of middle school preteens. And so, I tried to make white friends, did white people things, liked white girls, and tried to dress like white boys (who, ironically, at the time, tried to dress like black rappers - 3XL single-colored t-shirts and pants at the waist.) My parents probably thought I was messed up, but I think they were just happy that I got on okay with school. Thinking back, I've made some life-long Asian friends throughout my life that were "real Asians" deep down but were just as good at pretending that they were not. In any case, I had always chalked that weird period up to being a child desperately adjusting to a situation that would've been formative even for a native child, and while that WAS the reason, I never really considered the consequence that that served as the pervasive foundation of my new found identity. Thank god for Tupac and Eminem for intervening, but that's a story for another day.</p><hr /><p>There is an implicit and unwavering certainty in my dedication to studying the brain from a biological and physiological perspective, which is that I believe changing any aspect ourselves must first come from, and is a result of, a change in the physical substrate of our self, the brain. That certainty, while almost certainly scientifically correct, made me blind to the fact that changes to the brain and our fundamental identity can occur without intentionally altering the brain via mechanical (surgery), electrical, or chemical (drugs) interventions. The magical thing about how we - all organisms with nervous systems - have evolved is that we are able to receive sensory stimulus through our eyes and ears and change how our brain is wired without any conscious intervention. I don't know how, but this was the realization that came to me in those last 10 seconds of the film, and I suddenly understood our protagonist's face of horror and uncertainty as a reflection of the terror that, after having been hypnotized repeatedly, would he ever be the same person again? The metaphor of the brain surgery and hypnosis-induced burial of self-identity materialized itself for what it really stood for: unconscious integration of an external culture into our own identity. Having the shot of adrenaline definitely amplified this paranoia, but in that moment, I sat there in the theatre, a single Asian person surrounded by matrices of white movie-goers on a Saturday night, wondering to myself: who the fuck am I? And how do I make everybody else <strong>get the fuck out</strong> of my head?</p><p>For those last 10 seconds of the film, and the credits afterwards, my face probably mimicked Chris'. To put it less dramatically, I was scanning through every single one of my preferences and aversions - food, fashion, music, values - for the subconscious infiltration of Western (white) culture. To put it more dramatically, my sense of identity was shattered. After the adrenaline washed away, I was less paranoid and I could entertain the thought of watching a TV show or reading the news again, but the question remained: which parts of my "self" had I unknowingly accepted as my own, subconsciously brainwashed into buying into?&nbsp;And which, more importantly, at a cost of my previous -&nbsp;original -&nbsp;cultural identity? That was my interpretation of the metaphor the film ultimately tries to impress upon us, in addition to, and almost orthogonal to, the literal racist treatments that black people receive from suburban white people. What sort of ideologies and qualities had we idolized without consciously choosing, because the dominant social structure dictates so? I use "we" very loosely here, because, obviously, I'm not black. In fact, I won't really talk about the message as it is intended for African Americans, not because I don't sympathize or think it's important, but because I don't have the authority or experience to speak on it. I can, however, talk about my experience as an Asian immigrant. And while there is in no way as complex nor dark of a <a target="_blank" href="http://atlantablackstar.com/2017/03/15/sunken-place-jordan-peeles-get-reminds-public-education-system/">history</a> (or current social and political climate), I think my experiences were similar in that they were different from the predominant acceptable way of living life in North America, if not in the difference itself.</p><p>So who am I? Well, I'm not sure. Taken to the extreme, we are of course (mostly) a sum of our experiences. And while being situated in a Western culture can immerse us in one set of subconscious routines, our parents, friends, and people we meet also impart us with their own, sometimes inherited from THEIR own culture and power structures. The difference is, though, your parents have your best intentions in mind when teaching you values or how to represent yourself, and there is usually a rich cultural history behind those set of customs. The other? Maybe not so much. At the same time, I'm not saying any single white person is at fault here: not my neighbors and classmates who acted and dressed a certain way because it was their culture, and not even those who made fun of mine because it was foreign and different, because that's what people do. Nonetheless, it shocked me to realize that a lot of things that I thought were "normal" not because they were, but because of the environment I was in. I'll give you an example: packing sandwiches for lunch. My parents were of course perplexed with my request for sandwiches as my lunch items, instead of leftover rice and vegetables.&nbsp;And I requested them because that's what "normal" kids did, and if I wanted to be cool, I had to be normal first, so sandwiches please. I don't even like fucking sandwiches, but to this day, I still think that's the normal item of choice for lunch. That is, of course, a harmless example, but there are examples that are not so innocent, like subconscious values or the way we try to shape our mental and physical selves. Again, I don't want to do a disservice to the way this film aims to represent the black struggle, but a simple Googling should suffice your further curiosities.</p><hr /><p>I will end with this, and I will try to not sound like a paranoid conspiracy theorist: if anyone is concretely at fault here, it is the media. Again, I'm trying to not sound crazy here, but in my opinion, that is the reason why the takeover process in the film is completed via sitting in front of the television, and why Chris was watching TV when his mother died - it's a metaphor for foregoing his own (root) identity because he was locked into something that told him what he should be instead. I've understood for some time now that how media portrays something influences the way we think about that thing. But last night was really the first time that I had the jarring realization that the way media portrays something influences the way we ARE,&nbsp;through influencing how we think about ourselves in relation to what is portrayed as "normal". This, with full respect to the ways it could be and IS used to propagate dominance over racial and cultural groups, goes beyond just that. This is not just a black vs. white people thing, this is those who have control over content vs. those who don't.</p><p>Incredibly, the theme of this movie converged on what we've been experiencing for the past little while now, with reference to our current political "situation", that hyper-connectivity benefits those who control the communication channels the most. I'm an independent content creator and I have a blog, which means that there probably will be 3 times as many people who read it than had I not been able to share it on Facebook and Twitter. A step up, if I were a consumer product conglomerate, I would be able to buy an ad that lets 1000 times as many people see it by recommending it through Facebook or Google Ad. But if I was really, really rich, I could, theoretically, tailor your online experience exactly the way I want to. Post election night, we focused a lot on "echo chambers" within our own social networks, and that is obviously one component of the bigger problem. But we can't ignore the fact that somebody actually has control over this stuff, be it social media or actual media. Mark Zuckerberg (and his engineers) probably didn't actively influence the way Facebook bubbles shaped as much as Fox News worked to actively represent things in a certain light, but that doesn't mean it's less dangerous. If anything, the amorphous and invisible forces has no one to answer to and thus has no need for moral judgement.</p><p>Like I said, I considered stop watching TV and getting off social media altogether last night. Now that nerves calmed, I think trying to be more aware is probably a good first step. Going back to my conflict between being Asian and white: the infiltration of my mind by invisible social forces is jarring and unpleasant, and I'm not even that whitewashed.&nbsp;But on the flip side, mixing of cultures with white people, black and brown people, and other Asian people is part of what makes being an immigrant life beautiful in its own way (so says Mei, anyway). For now, I will probably just try to find my roots in soup dumplings and less tanned skin - fuck, I think Asian people like fair skin because of Western media influences in Asia.</p><p>Alright, tin foil hat back on.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>11/52: Cycles &amp; Sublime</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/3/24/1152-cycles-sublime</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mar 23, 2017 (For week of Mar 13)</p><p>Our hearts beat every second or so, again and again, but those microscopic loops are unraveled to become a line connecting the previous moment and the next, making a minute, an hour, a day.&nbsp;From the moment we regain consciousness, up to the moment we drift off to sleep -&nbsp;day after day - we slowly crawl forward from one time unit to the next. Our clocks are circular, perhaps only because it is more mechanically efficient to make them so, since for us, passage of time through life itself is a journey with a well-defined direction - forward. If we ever come to know the time of our own demise, or that of our universe, we will start making clocks that count up, or down, towards it;&nbsp;I am sure of it.</p><p>The day starts and ends with sunrise and sunset, and in between them, a day becomes a dot in the line connecting months, years. Somehow, we've done an remarkable job in unfolding cyclic and non-linear processes into a line - such is the curse of time moving forward, or rather, of how we experience it. But when I stop to experience the day at these most crucial moments, moments separating day and night, one dot from the next, time itself seems to suddenly fill with material, the moment becomes palpable - sublime -&nbsp;out of thin air. In these brief seconds before the sun falls below the horizon, the sky explodes with what seems to me like the set of all possible colors, and a paradox. The paradox is that while the moment itself being so brief, when measured by the turning across equidistant ticks in our machines, it has never failed to feel like an eternity. I'm never sure of the theatrics that I'm watching (or participating in?), or what exactly I'm anticipating, but I'm anticipating something. Am I rooting for the immaculately shaped fireball to disappear, or to stay? When it does quietly sneak away, though, I feel an even stranger sense of satisfaction, as if I've experienced the most climatic finale of a heroic tale. The story ends, and starts again tomorrow.</p>

<hr /><p>I don't do this often, but being on the edge of the continent overlooking the Pacific is a privilege I have learned to not take for granted. But it was only until very recently did I witness the opposite: the sun peeking through the emerald surfaces of the Caribbean Sea. Actually, it is the moment itself that gives the sea its crystalline turquoise. The upside-down birth of the sun itself gives birth to all that we see. More, in fact, as the golden threads weaving these clouds only reveal themselves for this tiny moment, and then they disappear.</p><p>And it was in that moment I realized that the story never ends: whenever and wherever there is a sunset, there is always a sunrise at that exact same instant for someone else on this Earth. There is no beginning nor end, yet it always tells a story. Or rather, we always tell a story about it.</p>

      <title>10/52: "Scientists discover how to upload knowledge to your brain."</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/3/16/1052-scientists-discover-how-to-upload-knowledge-to-your-brain</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>March 16, 2017 (For week of March 6)</p><p>I was thinking to myself the other day: "hmm, I haven't come across a really shitty news article about brain science recently, I wonder if science journalists in the neurosciences stepped up their game after feeling the pressure from my intensely popular blog posts about science communication?"</p><p>Then, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/01/scientists-discover-how-to-download-knowledge-to-your-brain/">this gem</a> dropped out of the sky into my lap (thanks Kelvin). Give it a read, it's worth it.</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1386.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/58ca266a2994ca8ee765de6b/1489643352873/Screen+Shot+2017-03-16+at+12.44.52+AM.png.52+AM.png?format=original" alt="I can't think of a more click-bait name than this, honestly. Whatever they're paying these people, it's not enough."/> I can't think of a more click-bait name than this, honestly. Whatever they're paying these people, it's not enough.[/caption]


<p>Are you not entertained?</p><p>Apparently, since I last popped my head up from working on some trivial problems in neuroscience, somebody had gone and figured out how to directly upload knowledge to our brains! (I had to look thrice to make sure that this wasn't the fucking Onion.)</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Whoa, I know Kung-Fu.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>

</figure><p><strong>What journalists think scientists did:</strong><br />So, what happened here? Well, first, according to this news article, "scientists" believe that we could soon feed knowledge directly into the brain Matrix-style, and researchers "claim" to have already developed a stimulator that can do so. Uh...so which is it? Can we already do it or will we be able to do it soon? And who the hell are these scientists and researchers claiming that?</p><p>Okay, nevermind that. On the next line, we learn that apparently it only "amplifies" learning, and on a much smaller scale than seen in Matrix. This is Good Journalism 101: if your readers are not disappointed by the third paragraph, you're not doing it right.</p><p>But wait! On the very NEXT line, it says that scientists "studied electric signals in the brain of a trained pilot and fed the data into novice subjects...and improved their piloting abilities and learned the task 33% better." The article goes on to conclude with some words like "neuro-plasticity" and "synergy of cognitive and motor performance", and reminds us that Egyptians used electric fish to stimulate the brain some 4000 years ago.</p><p><strong>What I think the scientists did after reading this article:</strong><br />So the article itself sends some confusing messages. In the best possible interpretation (or is it the worst?), these scientists were able to directly upload the skills of flying a flight simulator into some novice brains. This is fucking groundbreaking! Why? This implies that we've broken the code with which the brain encodes information, such as concepts of altitude and speed, as well as motor commands. Not only that, we can now upload that information directly and through digital means in a completely nonchalant way to random volunteers! Why the hell do we still have training programs?!? This is literally Captain America: the Winter Soldier!</p><p>Okay, maybe this optimal reading is a bit too literal (I mean literal as in I'm literally reading the words that are showing up on my screen.)&nbsp;Afterall, had that been true, this paper probably would've been in Nature AND Science in the same week, not Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.&nbsp;Nothing wrong with Frontiers, I just don't typically see papers casually break the neural code there, that's all.</p><p>So then, to be fair, this news article pares back and seems to inject a hint of actual scientific rigor. In this interpretation, scientists recorded brain signals from trained pilots and played them back into the novices' brains through an electrical stimulator. Having adjusted my expectations appropriately as such, I was actually pretty excited about this result. The method itself is plausible enough: record voltage fluctuations on the scalp (EEG) of the professional, and play it back on the scalp of the novice, and apparently it facilitates learning! This would also be pretty groundbreaking (less sarcastically so)&nbsp;and it would ask many more questions than it would answer, such as: "why the hell should that work at all?" Everyone's EEG is pretty unique, and if playing that back onto someone else's brain helps them learn, it would mean that there are some invariant brain signatures that represent certain skills or information in general. I can hardly contain my excitement at this point. So I dig up <a target="_blank" href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00034/full">the paper</a>, and what did these folks do?</p><p><strong>What the scientists actually did:</strong></p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Sham or actual tDCS was applied with the Starstim system (Neuroelectrics) following the finger tapping task (see Figure 1A). The total current applied was 2 mA, with scalp current density of 0.04 A/m2 for active tDCS (for 60 min), or 0.1 mA (0.002 A/m2) for sham tDCS (for 1 min).<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; Methods: tDCS. Choe et al., 2016</figcaption>
</figure><p>Fuck you, the Telegraph.</p><hr /><p>Addendum: I would've ended this rant right there, but I think my non-neuroscience friends wouldn't get the joke. Basically, tDCS is a method of brain stimulation, a very unsophisticated one at that. tDCS stands for transcranial Direct Current Stimulation. Transcranial as in through the head, and Direct Current as in...that's right, direct current. Essentially, tDCS is connecting a (or many) 9 Volt battery to your head such that a steady flow of electrons comes out of the battery and through your head. It is as unexciting as you could possibly make brain stimulation to be (though it is literally shocking), and it certainly does not track the "recorded brain signal of the professional pilot". I don't even know where this journalist person got that idea from. I re-read the Methods section like 4 times just to make sure I didn't miss something that was super important, but nowhere in there (nor in the abstract &amp; introduction) does it mention variable brain stimulation. As far as I can tell, the innovation in this study is the concurrent recording of brain signals with brain stimulation, and a more focal/ spatially precise way of stimulating the brain, which is achieved through a new fancy system. Other than that, the experiment is literally to compare the performance of those that were hooked up to a battery during training versus those that weren't.&nbsp;</p><p>Addendum to the addendum: I honestly can't imagine how this news article could have come out so wrong. It seems like the main authors of the scientific paper are not at an academic institution, so perhaps their PR team wasn't equipped with dealing with "science journalism". I cannot imagine what the authors must be thinking right now, though I suppose there is no bad publicity, especially if people won't even realize this is bad publicity. For all I know, somebody could've read this and thought we can plug into the Matrix now, and that's where I swoop in and save the day from bad science journalism. Go me! Also, I realized I did not make a comment on the actual scientific finding, which is that, as unsophisticated as zapping your brain with a (DC) battery is, it led to actual performance gains overall, as measured by some flight-landing metrics. I honestly don't know too much here, but I will say that this finding falls squarely within a larger context of the contentious debate about whether tDCS actually does something to your brain, as <a target="_blank" href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.mx/2016/04/what-we-think-we-know-and-dont-know.html">summarized very nicely here</a>.</p><p>So the take-home message? Please, for the love of god, don't get your science from the Telegraph.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>9/52: Don't compare your Mile 1 to someone else's finish line.</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/3/5/952-dont-compare-your-mile-1-to-someone-elses-finish-line</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's funny how life works sometimes. Last Friday, I got on campus just before noon like a good graduate student, and on my walk to the office, I saw one of our department admins standing behind a table with a stack of Subway sandwich boxes, right beside the door to a classroom into which people who collected the free lunch entered. Should I should carry on with what I'd planned to do, or sit through an hour long seminar with some free lunch? Turns out, the event was to celebrate Black History Month and honor the black scientists that have had tremendous impact with their research on the brain and cognition. I'd actually gotten emails for it a few days ago and thought it might be interesting, and now armed with the prospect of free food, it is an offer I cannot refuse. Turns out, it was one of the most illuminating experiences I've had at, and about, graduate school.</p><p>Our own Dr. Lara Rangel gave 20-minute talks about 3 prominent black scientists across the country: Todd Coleman, Carl Hart, and my favorite, Dr. (^2) Emery Brown. Her short exposition on his life and professional experiences were very well done, and one thing that stood out for me in particular was a snippet of this <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/JW1lDdB9Qs4?t=37m38s">video</a> she shared. It was an informal talk &amp; Q&amp;A session he gave at MIT where he talked about his career trajectory starting from he was in high school. The link starts the video at his answer to one of the questions, in which he summed up the experiences of medical and graduate school, sorta like a condensed version of the whole talk itself. But the whole thing, albeit long, is very worth checking out (if you're really short on time and don't believe me that he's a super dope guy, go to 1:07:00).</p><p>So who is this guy? Just to keep it brief, for folks outside of the neuroscience community: Emery Brown is a clinician-scientist who is a practicing anesthesiologist and also studies the effect of anesthetics on the brain, using pretty sophisticated mathematical and computational tools. To me, he seemed like a guy who knew just about everything. In my limited experience, most clinician-scientists' research geared more towards the clinical side, and less about mechanisms in a scientific sense. Not that that's a bad thing, but it's a framework that I can't relate to as much.&nbsp;Emery Brown, though, felt to me more like a full-time computational scientist who just happened to be a doctor, and his appointments and accomplishments reflect that. This is a guy who, among many other prominent academics - like the Sejnowskis and the Buzsakis and the Eve Marders and the Geoff Hintons -&nbsp;you aspire to mimic some day.&nbsp;</p><p>So why was this short session illuminating? Well, academia, like medicine or law or business or professional sports or anything really, is an field with clear signposts of success, as well as being full of high-achieving people. Often times, we look to these prominent figures in the field AS markers for success, and we aim to emulate what they've done in order to achieve success as well. The problem is, though, that most of these people are well into their careers, often in their 50s or 60s. And when you look at the paths left behind by those who have summited peak after peak in their lives, it is simultaneously inspiring and defeating - how could I ever hope to get there? You see where I'm going with this. When a green-horned graduate student into their 3rd or 5th year of full-time science looks at someone 30 or 40 years senior to them, how could it feel like anything but an endless life of playing catch-up? And that is why I found the session (and the Youtube video) so enlightening: it told his story from beginning to end, specifically, when he was also just a medical and graduate student, and how quirky he was then.</p><p>Everyone has a story, starting from when they're a baby to when they're greying and brittle. In academia, we pluck out the success stories and invite them to talk about their scientific achievements and newest discoveries, but rarely about their personal journey wading through successes and failures - lots and lots of failures. When we do talk about someone when they were young, we pretty much only talk about the Einsteins and Newtons - Nobel-quality work at the tender age of 25. We rarely get to hear about how someone's family and culture and social and economical background influenced how they got to where they are today. But those are the stories that are worth telling.&nbsp;Sure, they're usually not glamorous at all, and that's the point: most of our lives on the day to day are not glamorous, whether if you're a medical student or graduate student, or a young professional in any industry.</p><p>I think the growth of science communication on social media where professionals can share their own stories, as well as being in a lab that encourages failures and personal lives, made me more tuned in to that than otherwise, and I like where it's going. But in general, I think, for every scientific discovery worth disseminating, there is a personal story that's just as, if not more, inspiring. I'm not saying this because I think we need to feel good about ourselves all the time and it should be all sunshine and no struggles, but exactly the opposite: your life, and everyone's around you, is filled with ups and downs, twists and turns, diverging and converging interests, even if it is the life of a world-renowned anesthesiologist and brain scientist. Hearing those side quests makes us hopeful that our own side quests are also full of meaning - sometimes meaning yet to be discovered.</p><p>Finally, he had some parting advice specifically for Lara's presentation to us, which I've taken the liberty to share (directly from her slides):</p>

      <title>8/52: Science as a belief system.</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/2/13/852-science-as-a-belief-system</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feb 26, 2017</p><p>Disclaimer<br />Before I get on with the post, I have to make known that I think the scientific process is one of the most valuable tools we have as humanity, and that I am (obviously) not anti-science, nor am I anti-vaccination or anti-climate change.&nbsp;The following is simply a thought exercise that aims to examine my own belief system, as well as an attempt to draw some insight in the way we maintain knowledge about the world. Given the current political climate, it may be untimely to write something that presents itself as anything other than throwing my full weight behind science. But that is precisely what I'm doing: improving the way we think about, and communicate to others, the truth about how science works.</p><hr /><p>First, I think it's useful to distinguish the two meanings we invoke when we say "science". First and foremost, science is a method (or process)&nbsp;that iteratively attempts to converge on fundamental and useful descriptions of the world we live in, be it in physics, biology, or economics. It's making assumptions, gathering evidence, and re-examining the assumptions if anything surprising is observed. On the other hand, "science" also describes the body of knowledge gathered thus far via the scientific process, sometimes known as scientific truths or facts. This is a body of knowledge that has allowed us to make tremendous modern advances via engineering and medicine - applied sciences. By analogy, the former science is the method by which you build a house, from foundation to rooftop, and the latter is simply the house that was created in the process. The process itself is not attached to the resulting product, ideally at least. In fact, the fundamental principle of the scientific process, in a way, tries to rip down the house as it is being built, with the hopes of building another one with much studier foundations. The distinction between the two took me many years and many contentious conversations with friendly people to figure out, but I think I've finally converged on how to express what I think the problem is properly.</p><p>Science, as a body of knowledge, needs to be communicated. Consider how most of us acquire scientific knowledge about the world nowadays: we have science classes in high school, and if you were so inclined, you could take science courses in university or college as well. What about in areas outside of your concentration, and after you graduate? Unless you pursue a graduate degree in science itself, it is most likely that your formal science education ends there, and anything you learn moving forward comes from secondary sources, such as magazines, news/internet articles, or even word of mouth. After all, I don't think many of us gather our beliefs from primary research articles, nor should we be required to in order to "learn" or "understand" something. Nevertheless, many of us have learnt to build a belief system on the foundations of scientific facts - not the process itself, but the knowledge acquired. Common examples: the Earth is round and revolves around the Sun, gravity is an universal force, medicine works better than prayers.</p><p>Now, it might seem inconceivable, but we could replace that foundation with any other body of knowledge, be it folk wisdom, anecdotal stories, or religious teachings. In fact, I am under the impression that, as a body of knowledge, facts about God and religion-guided moral codes were transmitted in very similar ways prior to the last few decades, and it has only been recently that scientific facts have replaced religious facts as the common belief system. Note that I am not drawing an equivalence between scientific facts and religious "facts". Obviously, the process in which we generate scientific facts is tied very closely to the scientific process, which is fundamentally different from how religious facts are generated. Nor am I saying that religious ideas have no place in our society - quite the contrary, when used effectively, it is an excellent tool in building our human community. What I am saying, however, is that when removed from the process, or the context, of the fact-generating mechanism itself, scientific truth is just a set of belief system that can be easily exchanged with another, and that is the way it is most commonly portrayed in popular media: facts first and only, with little to no mention of the scientific context - history and process - in which the facts are generated. A simple way to test this is to ask yourself the following: take some scientific facts in a field unfamiliar to you, by which I mean that it was not your primary major in college, and think about why you believe what you believe, and why not the contrary. Why DO you believe the Earth is round? Or that evolution is real? Or that consuming fat is bad for you? More importantly, what are the alternative hypotheses and why are those invalid?</p>

<p>I raise these issues not to cast a shadow of doubt on their scientific merit, but to simply illustrate a point, which is that I personally, and I think many of us, hold scientific beliefs in the same way I hold many other everyday beliefs: I simply accept them to be true in good faith. Of course, the <strong>crucial</strong> difference between scientific and folk wisdom beliefs is that had I ever had any doubt on the truthfulness of a scientific finding, I could have looked up the original, peer-reviewed, research report(s). Although, having the ability to do so does not equate to having done so, and one important thing to keep in mind is that even having the thought of accessing primary research articles is outside the scope of many people in this country, much less having the means and skills to do so (e.g., keyword searches, getting through paywall).&nbsp;</p><p>With that setup, I am ready to state the problem: I think how we communicate the body of scientific knowledge directly contributed to the predicament we currently find ourselves in, namely, anti-science and post-truth. Science education in schools and popular media largely ignore the philosophy of science and how the process itself is a process of elimination. At best, when it is mentioned, it's casted as a fact-finding process, not a hypothesis-eliminating process. This is a subtle but very important difference: fact-finding tries to find observations to support a claim, while hypothesis-elimination tries to find observations to disprove a claim until none other is deemed satisfactory - and I must say, even scientists (myself included) get those two mixed up sometimes.&nbsp;Without informed opinion about how science as a process works, we do not have the context to properly and <strong>critically</strong>&nbsp;evaluate facts generated by it, and so, removed from the source, it is just another belief system. Naturally, then, we should face resistance from those that were not brought up with the same belief system. The key is that, an understanding of the scientific process allows you to see that this particular belief system is open to edits in an attempt to converge on the truth - often in non-linear trajectories and with significant setbacks. But without it, it just looks like whoever is making up these facts screws up a lot. The whole Andrew Wakefield vaccine debacle, for the scientific community, is an affirmation to the process itself, that we eventually <strong>will</strong>&nbsp;erase false knowledge through group effort. But without understanding the process, it is confirmation that scientists can't make up their minds. Are vaccines really okay or not? Are carbs healthy for you or not? Is the climate really changing if there is still some 1% of so-called "scientists" that deny it? How CAN we make those calls without understanding the social, cultural, and economical motives that drive, not only corporate scientists, but all scientists?</p><p>So we have multiple belief systems that are now judged to be equivalent, though one is methodologically more trustworthy than the rest (for a particular area of knowledge, at least). That is the problem, and what can we do about it now? Well, I don't think I'm saying anything that somebody somewhere hasn't said about science education, but it's important enough to keep repeating it: we need to focus more on the process, and not the facts. It's a lot of fun to watch a well-made YouTube video or well-written blog article talking about new scientific findings, but that cannot be the only thing. We have to educate people about the fact that this belief system that we call science is not like other belief systems, and it's founded on a rigorous set of principles that anybody can apply to generate new knowledge, not just scientists. There are professional scientists, and there are backyard/kitchen/<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpWQHFzrEqc">everyday scientists</a>. The facts are almost secondary: give a man a fish, feed him for a day; teach a man how to fish, feed him for a life. We need to educate people on how to look at a news article, be it scientific or world events, progressive or conservative, and be able to apply for themselves the hypothesis-eliminating procedure, instead of taking the information as is. The current information technology infrastructure in the form of social media and internet as a whole makes that a really hard thing to do: after all, who has the energy to rethink every piece of "information" they receive on Twitter or Facebook or Buzzfeed or what have you? I don't know what the solution to this bigger problem is, but I think emphasizing on disseminating information about the process itself is a good start.</p><hr /><p>Addendum: this took me several weeks of hand-wringing to figure out how to convey the message properly. I'm not 100% satisfied, but it's good enough for now. Thank you to everyone that had this conversation with me, all of those helped in distilling the difference between the process and the body of knowledge that is science. I remember the first time I had this thought was maybe about 4 years ago, and I probably blurted out something to my roommates like "guys, is science really different from religion?" I hope the answer is clear from the above. I am very interested in hearing about how most of you think about this framing, since most people that read my shit are science advocates, or at least pro-science. I also wonder if anyone on the other side can relate a bit better to this framing, instead of the usual "science is good for you and that's that".</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>7/52: How many clipping actions do you require to complete one fingernail-clipping session?</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/2/20/752-how-many-clipping-actions-do-you-require-to-complete-one-fingernail-clipping-session</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>February 19, 2017</p><p>If you cut your nail with your teeth on a regular basis, you should stop reading this right now. And probably go see a doctor and/or dentist.</p><p>Things that we have to do every once in a while for no good reason both fascinate and annoy the hell out of me. Getting a haircut is one of those things. Some people see it as an opportunity to renew - or recreate - their self-identity whenever they get a haircut, I see it as a waste of time and money because I want to get the exact same damn haircut every time, and if my head wasn't so god-awfully shaped, I would just buzz it with a number 1 all the way around myself. Honestly, if my head was an error surface, they would probably need to find new gradient descent algorithms because it would be deemed a pathological surface. But yo, free million dollar idea: a box that you can just stick your head in and it gives you any hair style you want. We don't even have to start fancy, I'll be satisfied with anything that a hair clipper could do.</p><p>But this week's enlightenment session is not about getting a haircut, it's about clipping my nails. Fingernails seem to be the thing least deserving of growth. Seriously. I can understand if it's something that breaks and needs replacing often, like skin. But nails literally never get damaged, UNLESS of course, it is too long. Does anyone break a finger nail doing anything the day after cutting them? I didn't think so.</p><p>"But Richard," you might say, "long nails are sometimes helpful, like when you need to scratch something off or open something that you need to wedge your nails into." First of all: don't. Breaking a nail trying to open one of those snap caps (like on ketchup bottles) is just the worst, and then you have some human compost to go with your eggs.&nbsp;Second of all, then why cut it at all? That's a very unreliable tool if it is only available to use half the time you need it, by choice. But actually though, this is the kind of shit that legitimizes when someone says: "sorry, I don't have finger nails", when they really mean to say "I really don't want to help you open that thing."</p><p>But now not only do you have a tool that's half reliable, you have to buy a second tool that is used to manage it. I think the modern day nail clipper, at first glance, is a beauty of engineering. That's one of those things that feels like it has reached the pinnacle of its evolutionary process: it lasts basically a life time and nothing on it does not directly serve the purpose that it was designed fo-&nbsp;I'm sorry, what? The hole in the back? You mean, you don't tie a string around your nail clipper and secure it on your belt loop so you can clip your nails at ALL possible times? Then you, my friend, are missing out on life. Don't get mad at the guy clipping his toe nails on the subway. BE the guy clipping toe nails on the subway.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing that's really fascinating about nail clippers is the fact that it's basically one size fits all, where it really has no business trying to be so. The average American household probably has at least 3 differently sized fingernail owners, and each of them has (at least) 3 differently sized finger nails. How did one go about <a target="_blank" href="http://gizmodo.com/5903385/weve-been-trimming-our-nails-wrong-for-more-than-100-years">designing</a> the curvature on that thing? Did someone conduct a focus group and decide on an average fingernail size? Or are we all participating in the world's longest-running and biggest Cinderella story? When the one true love of the fingernail-clipping prince clips her nails, it fits just right - ALL 5 of her fingers (holy shit!). Actually, sometimes I try to one-shot my index, middle, and ring finger nails, and when that happens, it feels magical. But when it doesn't, I'm reminded of the fact that there is no prince waiting for me in a distant land, and that not only am I not gifted with the perfectly shaped head, I also don't have 5 perfect fingers of equal radius of curvature.</p><p>Addendum: this weekly blog post thing basically serves as a reminder that I can write about anything.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>6/52: On CogSci, humility, and brain in a vat.</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/2/14/652-on-cogsci-humility-and-brain-in-a-vat</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feb 13, 2017 (For week of Feb 6)</p><p>Life gets crazy once in a while, and things fall through the crack. Here I am again, a day late on my weekly-scheduled blogging. I actually started writing (a very heavy) one yesterday and continued today, but I realized halfway through that I needed way more reflection to figure out what I actually want to say, and how I want to say it. So I will store that one for a future date and write about something more immediately relevant to my life this week. I apologize in advance if this offends anybody, I think I'm growing older and wiser, but sometimes it's really just the former.</p><hr /><p>Last week was Open House weekend for the department of Cognitive Science at UCSD, where prospective PhD students come in to visit and interview with professors. It was my 3rd time being on the hosting side (geez), and while out at a welcoming event, my friend (and fellow graduate student) Shuai asked me an innocent enough question that kept me thinking the whole weekend. He said that, about a year ago, I had openly declared at happy hour that "all this cognitive science stuff is bullshit", and that neuroscience is the real deal in figuring out how the brain works and how people are able to think. Fast forward to this year, about a few months ago, I had advised him to think about his own research in machine learning in a broader, cognitive science-driven perspective, both as a way of looking for unexpected insights, as well as to facilitate communication between his specific area of research and non-experts in the department.</p><p>I remember the second event very clearly, but not the first (and I was quite shocked I would say that out loud at a department happy hour). Well, in my first year and half or so, I was genuinely under the belief that cognitive science is useless: at best, it's people debating outdated philosophical ideas; at worst, it's a willful waste of research time and resource.&nbsp;But somehow, now that I'm in the middle of my third year, I have gained a more profound appreciation of what cognitive science tries to do, and I'm apparently advising younger students to follow suit. And although I (and people around me) have previously acknowledge my shift in attitude, I've never really paused to think about how that happened, and apparently so quickly at that. And that is what I am writing about today. Spoiler:&nbsp;it's not Stockholm Syndrome (I hope).</p><p>It's funny how life is, actually. Because the day after he asked me about this, our Chair (and literal (?)&nbsp;rock of the department), Marta Kutas, gave her opening address to the prospective students and talked about what she had learned from Cognitive Science at UCSD during her years here. Really, she had said one word that was able to capture very well what I have felt I've gained in my two and half years here, and that is humility. There is a lot I can say about it, but to keep it brief, I think there were 3 distinctive stages in how this had happened.</p><p>The first stage is when I realized, sometime last year, that what I'm really curious about is not how the brain works as a complex biological machinery, per se, but how that complexity enables us to think, laugh, feel, and lose those abilities when something goes wrong. I still think the brain itself is fascinating, and my day-to-day work revolves around figuring that out, which effectively makes me a neuroscientist. But I think the one truly meaningful impact I can make, and the one that I care a lot about, is to change the lives of people who are adversely impacted by a mishap in the 3 pound lump in their skulls, i.e. people with neurological and psychiatric disorders. And not to do so by finding a treatment that could alleviate their symptoms or even causes, but also to understand why.&nbsp;This is a profound yet subtle difference, and it really came after I finished reading <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Mistook_His_Wife_for_a_Hat">The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</a>, by the late Oliver Sacks. This realization came at a time when I felt myself getting lost while meandering in the sea of neuroscience literature, collecting fact after fact but with no real goal in mind (I will come back to later).&nbsp;All of the stories in that book are wonderfully amazing,&nbsp;yet I noticed a strange feeling in myself while reading about, for example, the Autistic Artist, and not for the disease itself, but how it impacted the way he thinks. It was a mixture of wonder, sadness, and the tiniest hint at a sense of purpose. I've yet to fully understand that feeling and what it means for my future, but I do know that I am neither a biologist nor a computer scientist - not those alone, at least.</p><p>Having been cued on the superbly diverse range of behaviors and thoughts a person can produce, as they do in the book, I started to notice a profound lack of exactly that in the modern scientific literature on neuroscience. Just to be clear, I'm not saying that there is nobody out there studying behavior, as there are groups doing very clever experiments, coupled with neuroscientific methods, precisely in an attempt to find the neural basis.&nbsp;I am also not saying that you can't do good work when looking only at biology or "computation" and don't consider behavior,&nbsp;that would be the pot calling the kettle black. What I am saying is that, I think the field of neuroscience as a whole understands how difficult of a problem it is to fully study behavior, thoughts, cognition, and thus (cleverly) do what we can to avoid getting our hands too dirty. I am making a slight caricature here, but the amount of paper I have read that puts a person squarely in a giant magnet doing some simple "cognitive task" (trying to not fall asleep), while claiming to have found some neural basis of such and such, is a few too many (very relevant:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(16)31040-6?elsca1=etoc&amp;elsca2=email&amp;elsca3=0896-6273_20170208_93_3_&amp;elsca4=Cell%20Press">this</a>&nbsp;new paper). Again, I get why these works exist, and I sympathize completely with my fellow graduate students and scientists, which just furthers my belief that it is a fucking difficult problem and neuroscience as a whole is largely trying to avoid the real business of human behavior and cognition. That, my friends, is humbling: to go from a hothead in my first year, believing that solving our thoughts through studying the brain is simply a matter of time, to realizing that I can count on two limbs the number of groups making a concerted effort on solving this problem in a reasonable way. Not even headway, but effort. Again, studying the brain from the perspectives of molecules, cells, genetics, and anatomy are all tremendously useful, and will ultimately prove to be the flashlights that we wield to illuminate mysteries about our consciousness and cognition, but those alone will not be sufficient.</p><p>And that brings me to:&nbsp;reacquaintance. In the very first academic term of my PhD, we had to take a class on the Foundations and History of Cognitive Science. This was ultimately the class that turned me off of cognitive science for a year, because all we talked about were papers from at least 2 decades ago debating about problems that were largely philosophical and seemingly had no real solutions or significance.&nbsp;I'll give you an example: does a brain isolated in a vat have cognition? ("Of course it fucking does, the brain has all the connections and information necessary, and it is the SOLE contributor to our mental experience. JUST TRY IT!") I concluded from there that cognitive scientists were mostly either armchair philosophers, or theorists so entrenched in their outdated ideas that they forget about the brain. In hindsight, this was obviously stupid (I can't imagine how chill of a person Seana has to be to not tell me I'm an idiot). What changed? Well, I realized that all (well, most of) the philosophical questions raised by cognitive scientists of the pasts are attempts at pinning down the exact thing we should be trying to study empirically, i.e. what is the mind/cognition.&nbsp;Since neuroscience has taken over as the flag-bearer of mind-mapping, we don't often hear about these philosophical brain twisters anymore. But that's not because we've solved these questions -&nbsp;all we did was to stop talking about them. And so once again, appreciation of the difficulty of these problems brought me humility, along with knowing that smart people around me are working on problems everyday that may not have anything to do with the brain, but are interesting in their own right and will, just like biology and genetics, shed some light on how our mind works - simply from another angle.</p><p>And that, is my journey after two and half years of PhD in Cognitive Science (half-way there, Ma!). It's funny how life works sometimes (I seem to say that a lot these days): I had no idea what cognitive science was coming out of engineering, then literally stumbling onto the department website and Brad's blog, then thinking to myself after a year here that I've made a huge mistake and should've enrolled in neuroscience, to today...well, I don't know what today is. Let's be clear, I still and will always think that the brain is the shit, and that we have to study the biological basis of our cognition via biological means, even if other forms of cognition can be instantiated (like AI). I guess I'm just a little bit more open to be inspired by other means.</p><p>Hopefully, I can provide some kind of answer soon on whether a brain in a vat (or a dish?) have cognition.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>5/52: My 5 butt words</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/2/6/552-my-5-butt-words</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feb 6, 2017 (for week of Jan 29)</p><p>Running late this (last) week, so I will post something nice and easy to make up for it. I'm not sure whether this was allowed under the rules of the challenge I set up, though I probably should've given myself at least 3 of these make-up pieces (1 down).</p><p>In any case, I've wanted to write about this for a while now.&nbsp;I write a lot as a graduate student, and on top of that, I keep this blog and somehow always find myself in the middle of very long Facebook chat conversations with essay-length responses. Because of that, I noticed that I tend to use a set of words for no good reason at all, and these sometimes actually transcend into my speech. So, without further ado, these are my top 5 pet-peeve words/phrases.</p><p>1. "Like"<br />Oldie but goodie, and I know I'm not the only person that gets annoyed at themselves for using this word. The canonical use of this word, of course, indicates an inability to describe something in a precise way (at best), and it's a substitute for "uh" (at worst).&nbsp;E.g., "the Falcons had, like, the biggest meltdown in Superbowl history!" Everybody knows this is the word to use (and "totally") if you want to sound like a Valley girl, so I guess it's not as offensive in California. But I use this word in another,&nbsp;quite different way. Sometimes when I'm describing an interaction between me and another person, I use "like" as a substitute for "said". Example: "I told my parents I drove the car off the road, and they were like 'how the hell did you manage that?'" In this case, "they said" is the proper English expression for what had happened, and I have no idea why, but "they were like" just rolls off the tongue (and keyboard). The problem is, in an exchange with multiple turns - and this really happens - I will tell the story as such: "he was like ..., then she was like ..., and then he was like ..., and then she was like..." This drives me nuts. Although, replacing "was like" with "said" does not make it sound any better. Or at least, I don't like it, maybe because "said" definitely implies direct quotation, whereas "was like" could be interpreted as speech or inferred attitude. In general, I haven't found a great way of narrating a story with a conversation that doesn't sound stupid.</p><p>2. "Basically"<br />This is another classic, exemplified by the following exchange:<br />A: "I know rainbows come out after it rains, but how does that actually work?"<br />B: "Basically, the rain..."</p><p>In my experience, only about 10% of the time when people say "basically", do they actually proceed to distill the concept into something understandable or more similar to a BASIC concept that the other person has experienced before. The other ~90% of the time, it really signals that they have no clue what the hell they are about to explain (myself included). Or maybe if they actually do understand internally, they have no good way of expressing that understanding. This has been my experience so often that whenever I feel like I'm about to start my explanation with "basically", I will stop myself from talking and think about whether I actually understand what I'm about to explain, and most of the time the answer is "basically, no". In fact, using the word "basically" actively hinders my own understanding of the topic.</p><p>3. "Definitely"<br />As in, "I definitely think this is a good idea..." "Definitely" is definitely a word that should be sprinkled sparingly. Obviously, the word conveys an increase in relative certainty in the context of the current conversation, as in "I think this will work, and that will work, but the other thing definitely won't work." But sometimes I will use this in multiple consecutive sentences to indicate my conviction. I don't think doing this is necessarily bad, but it does take away the meaning of the word, like the boy who cried sheep. After a string of "definitely"s, what if I was even MORE certain? Shall I use "definitively"?&nbsp;</p><p>4. "Just"<br />I use this a lot when I first send someone an email inquiring about something, like their paper, or asking for a favor: "Hi, I was just wondering if you can ..." This is the apologist Canadian in me, I guess. That example sentence is perfectly fine without the "just", but using the word (at least I think) downplays the importance/inconvenience of the whole request. Like, "I know you're busy, but I JUST need a few moments to..." This isn't annoying as much as it is funny to me, because I usually tend to err on the side of more polite/formal when I write to unfamiliar people (compared to not even using capitalization when I write to my lab. Sorry Roemer). But I do think this can introduce a power dynamic unfavorable for me even before I've even made my request, so I actively stop myself from using this word in emails and texts now. Let me know if I sound like an entitled ass without it.</p><p>5. "and stuff"<br />I just scrolled through Youtube for an hour to find <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/MxW4LZCYfvs?t=45s">this</a>. Worth.</p><p>This is probably the single most frustrating phrase for me. I used to always say it at the end of every sentence, then somehow, one day, I realized I have no idea what I'm referring to when I say "...and stuff". This, and its closely-related cousin, "and things." Next time you hear yourself say it, kindly ask yourself, "and what stuff?"</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>4/52: Rome is not built in a day, but it sure falls quickly.</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/1/29/452-rome-is-not-built-in-a-day-but-it-sure-falls-quickly</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jan 29, 2017</p><p>I had originally intended to write something lighthearted for this week, after two consecutive educational posts. But in light of recent events, I felt I was neither able to, nor was it totally appropriate, given what's happening in this large dumpster fire known as the US of A. Worse, this deviates from my original intent of posting something that has one central message - I simply don't have any today, so it will just be bullet points of my stream of consciousness in an attempt to jot down some thoughts I've had in the last 48 hours or so.</p><p>First and foremost, I think, I have to admit to myself I was wrong. During the election months, I thought to myself, there's no way Donald Trump is going to do any of the stuff he said, the sane/slow parts of government simply won't let him, just look at how Obama struggled to do some very simple and beneficial things. Even on the night of the election, I told myself and people around me that there's nothing to worry about, even if he IS the president, he has limited ability in what he can accomplish given the structure of the government. Well, I must admit that after one full week of the new presidency, I was wrong. In a short week, he's not only signed executive orders gagging science, but also on starting construction of the wall and banning Muslim refugees (and immigrants &amp; residents!)&nbsp;From a rational perspective, I'm not sure how effective the executive orders will be in the end, and I'm not sure he does either. But I realized that, those things I thought were impossible were quickly realized within a week, and that means the line I had drawn for myself has been crossed. To be very honest, I think I was in the camp of, not quite "let's give him a chance", but more like "let's see how it goes", because he was legally elected and everybody becomes more presidential when they're in the hot seat, right?&nbsp;Wrong.</p><p>What about the last two days that has made me become more emotionally charged than ever about the commander-in-cheeto? Because, afterall, it's not like he hasn't said or done outrageous things to Muslims, women, LGBTQ, people of color (basically everybody not white) in the past 12 months. I think there are a few things. For one, as I've said above, it's a shellshocked feeling of something impossible happening, which makes you question the nature of reality, that if evidence has demonstrated that my assessment was wrong, then anything can happen from here, I have no clue! Another, of course, is probably sympathy for those afflicted, and in particular, Muslim (many of my friends) immigrants (most of my friends, and myself) and (to a much lesser extent) scientists. Seeing actual people being displaced and bullied, and knowing friends that will face the same daunting challenges had they gone back home to Canada, definitely makes this more real. I guess there was always some hope that as insane as the Republican party was, they'd at least do something when it counted. But I guess not, and so we're on our own. Well, I say we, but I'm Canadian. So you're on your own, Americans.&nbsp;</p><p>Just kidding. Canada is not immune to this <a target="_blank" href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN15E04S">bullshit</a> either.</p><p>So what will happen? I honestly have no clue. I've always wondered how great civilizations, like the Romans, who had built such great things (tremendous things) using thousand-year-old technology, ever dissolved into the winds of history, and all we can observe are the ruins of once great empires. Well, I haven't figured that out, but it sure feels like it's happening right now. I think what drove home for me was the extent at which people refused to have conversations acknowledging facts. Not even "scientific facts", because I think that requires an understanding of the process and that knowledge is always fallible, but ACTUAL facts, like what Donald Trump did or said and when, or how many people were at the inauguration, or the fact that, as far as we know, zero people from the banned countries have committed acts of terror on US soil. How is "alternative facts" a thing?!? To me, that's the biggest challenge to overcome - how do we communicate within a shared reality with people who fundamentally distrust anything that contradicts their beliefs? And I'm not saying this is strictly a Trump-voter phenomenon, left-wingers are of course also susceptible to confirmation bias, it just so happens that the broader scientific (medical, tech, etc) community falls mostly in the progressive camp.</p><p>What can we do? After several conversations about protesting, and realizing the scope of both the Women's March and the spontaneous airport protests, I've gained an appreciation for how important protests and rallies are in consolidating a voice of support for those that are being oppressed. Case in point, to welcome people detained at airports. But I'm not sure to what extent I can believe that protests can motivate political changes anymore. There used to be a time when government representatives gave a shit about common folks that protested en mass. But these days the line between red and blue states are so deeply drawn that there's little to no reason for a governor in a red state to give two shits about what progressives have to say. Refugee intake and abortion are fundamentally independent issues but for whatever reason, they've become totally correlated. Again, I am by no means criticizing rallies, I think they serve an important purpose in letting the world know, whoever that is, that there are people that still care. Maybe that will be enough to flip some voters, but that won't effect any political action till a few years later. Also, it's not a certainty anymore that the constitution and laws of the land will be upheld anymore. But then again, why should they be? Lawmakers make laws, so they can break old laws to make new laws, and that's what the House will do to enable more of this ridiculous behavior. In the end, it comes back to this sinking feeling that we are so powerless in a supposedly democratic process, and the structure has been set up such that reason does not prevail against tradition.</p><p>But the question is, still, what can we do? For myself, I think there have always just been two things, and I'm not at all claiming these are the right things to do or prescribing them for anyone else. First, it is to support and advocate for people who are negatively impacted by what's happening, be it emotionally or financially. Maybe go to more protests, donate a little bit, and support people who ARE making an active effort, in their own ways, to do the same. Admittedly, I don't think I've been the best at that, because often times I feel a paralysis trying to do the "best thing" by considering all sides. But I think the time has come to do what I think is the right thing, in the face of uncertainty. The second thing, as always, is to stay focused, fact-driven, and open minded. Like I said, progressives are not immune to echo chambers or fake news, it takes two to tango. Just because we believe in climate change, doesn't mean we can't also believe in some absurd notion of right and wrong. I think it's very important to not demonize regular people that have a different set of biases than us, though this is much easier said than done. Yesterday, I scrolled through #muslimban on Twitter in hopes of seeing what the other side (Trump nation) is saying about this, and I gotta say, it was not pretty. No lie, in the rage of that moment I thought to myself, for the first time ever, "well if they don't want to believe in facts, fuck them. They can be left in the backwards ass country they are tweeting from." But that came from a place of anger, not thought or consideration. And while I have no idea how to accomplish this right now, I think the best I can do is to be an active participant in communicating science. Not just in the traditional sense, as in to craft messages in a lay-friendly way, but to re-discover what works for these groups of people that are actively hostile towards science and the ivory institution. Probably the hardest thing I will ever do, once I figure out how.</p><p>To end on a good note, I think Donald Trump will make America great again, just not in the way he thought he would. From what I've seen in the last week: yes there is a flaming pile of shit hurtling at us, but people will not go down without a fight, and he's giving people an opportunity to unite and do what's right. Let's just try to stay on the right side of history again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>3/52: Can we ever accomplish non-consensual brain-reading? [Part 2]</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/1/22/352-can-we-ever-accomplish-non-consensual-brain-reading-part-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jan 22, 2017</p><p>Two days after I wrote last week's blog piece, someone mentions in class that somebody had just done a study where they found common representation of memory across different people's brains. I thought to myself, "well that is just absurd." But that someone happened to be Terry Sejnowski, so I thought he probably knows what he's talking about. So I dug up the study, which, as it turns out, was only published about a month ago. Well, after having read through it, I wouldn't quite say there was common representation of thought between people, but it was interesting enough that I thought it warranted an unexpected Part 2 to last week's post.</p><p>The paper in question is "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27918531">Shared memories reveal shared structure in neural activity across individuals</a>", from (mainly) Uri Hasson's group in Princeton. Before I get into it, I want to review why I thought inter-subject decoding is an impossibility (for a detailed exposition, go to previous post). There are 3 main reasons: first, brains between different individuals are not the same anatomically; second, you need to build a different brain-to-thought dictionary for each person; and three, each person's thoughts are contextualized by their own lives, e.g., "apple" does not mean the same to me as it is to you if I've only ever eaten green apples and you, red. The third reason is more or less the motivation for the second, but solving either of them will bypass the decoding problem, hence I included them as distinct.</p><p><strong>Overcoming the the challenges of inter-subject decoding</strong><br />Well, I still maintain that we cannot achieve non-consensual thought-reading, but this study WAS able to find shared structure in neural activity across different individuals. How? Their experimental design directly overcame two of the three issues I raised above. The setup was as follows: each participant comes in to the lab and lies in an MRI scanner for an hour while watching a movie (BBC's Sherlock woohoo!) and getting their brain scanned. Afterwards, they were told to recount the story from the movie while also getting their brain scanned. Finally, the brain data is organized by scene, where brain activity from the same scene is averaged across time. This is done for all 17 subjects, and there are two main comparisons of interest here: similarity of brain activity of the same person between watching and recounting the same scene, and similarity of brain activity of two different people recounting the same scene.</p><p>So how did they overcome two of the issues I mentioned? First, the experimenters transformed all the brain data to a common space, an "average brain" of some sort. There are several of these average templates in the fMRI world, they basically need to pick one, and warp and stretch every individual's brain such that it matches this anatomical average. This gets past the "different brains" problem. Second - and this is subtle but very important -&nbsp;the participants all watched the same movie! By doing so, all the memories or "thoughts" about events in the movie are more or less contextualized by the same things, i.e., scenes before and after. Of course, they can never be exactly the same. For example, someone who is a self-proclaimed Cumberbitch (me) will probably react very differently (emotionally) to scenes which he is in, compared to someone who hates his acting and British accent. In addition, objects in the scene may trigger spontaneous thoughts from a participant's own life, like seeing a horse and remembering their own horse-riding experience, which cannot happen for someone that's never ridden one.&nbsp;But by and large, the same sensory cues are used by everyone to stitch the story together into a coherent movie. And in this way, they have manufactured "shared memories".</p><p>So, were they successful in finding shared structure between people who shared a similar experience? Well, successful enough to get published. Again, there are a few possible comparisons they look at here, but I will just focus on the one: similarity of brain activity of two different people recounting the same scene.&nbsp;The brain data for each person is basically two 2-dimensional matrices,&nbsp;scene-by-brain region (voxel), since they collapsed all the measurements during a scene into a single average. One of the matrices is made from the watching data, which we don't care about, and one from the recounting data.</p><p><strong>Recounting for different people</strong><br />This is our main question: when two people talk (and think) about the same experience, do they evoke similar patterns of brain activity? In this study, they didn't quite look at the one-to-one comparison. Instead, they compared an individual's brain activity to the average of everyone else's. The math is super simple: for a single brain area (voxel), correlate the scene values of a single person with that of the average of the rest, and do this for all the voxels in the brain. To test for significance, they compared to a null distribution built from the correlation between different scenes (which should be around zero).&nbsp;Figure 3 from the paper illustrates this result (below). Sub-panel b shows the areas of the brain for which there was significant correlation, mostly covering the higher visual areas, temporal regions, and posterior medial cortex (PMC, circled). They further show that at the PMC voxels, most people's correlation ranged between 0.1 to 0.3, which is presumably the best region they could find. These seem like small numbers, and they are, but compared to pure chance, they're still pretty good considering all the noise and extraneous influences onto every person's brain while recounting the movie, and that's not considering how their memories all differ in a different way from the original movie itself. All this is to say, there is some non-zero correlation between the brain activity of two different people describing similar things, but it is definitely not quite to the level of thought-reading across different people.</p>

<p><strong>In conclusion</strong><br />So in conclusion, while this is not at all the same as reading one person's thoughts from their brain activity based on another person's thought-to-brain dictionary, it's still an advance in the general direction, though I'm not sure we'll ever get there asymptotically, especially when we're talking about non-consensually. There are some implications, however. For one, we've known for a while that sensory representation share some structure across different people, like how everyone's visual cortex is in the back of their head, but "memory" representation seems to also share some spatial structure. Now, we can talk about what "memory" really is, is it even a separate thing from replaying of sensory experiences, but that's for another time. The paper also describes several other findings that are interesting, such as the similarity of brain activity, within the same person,&nbsp;between watching and describing the movie. Intuitively, we'd expect that memories should be pretty similar, but not exactly the same, as the sensory experience itself, though there's no reason why they should share any similarity in the spatial structure of their representation. But that is what the study has found (also with correlation between 0.1 to 0.3). One caveat here is that finding correlation between brain activity is not the same as actual decoding, i.e. interpreting the memory itself based on the brain activity. When the space of possible memories is limited to a pool of 50 movie scenes, it becomes a relatively straightforward classification task (which they perform, as another experiment), which means you can have zero knowledge about the visual &amp; audio features and still be able to guess the scene. But in general, brain-reading that might be used in any meaningful way will have to be able to decode the visual/audio/affective features AS images/sounds/emotions, not just a categorical scene label.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>2/52: Can we ever accomplish non-consensual brain-reading?</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/1/14/252-can-we-ever-accomplish-nonconsensual-brain-reading</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jan 14, 2017</p><p>Back when I worked at InteraXon (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.choosemuse.com/">Muse</a>) making the consumer EEG device, we often get investors and journalists that visit to check out our tech. Part of my job was to strap them with our 4-channel EEG and take them through a demo app. The number one joke that everybody tells, upon seeing their brainwave on the computer screen, is: "Hey,&nbsp;I have a brain! My wife never believed me!" (For some reason, they were almost always men).</p><p>The second most common comment I got, though, is: "you can't read my thoughts with this, right?" I could never tell whether they were joking. I think some were, but some were seriously concerned. In fact, we had a company template for responding to that question on the website, which is to compare the EEG headset to a heart rate monitor, with which one can only gather a person's general state of being, but not any precise thoughts.</p><p>Well, fast forward 3 years.&nbsp;Here I am,&nbsp;In the middle of a PhD studying computational and cognitive neuroscience. The technology we were using was obviously not good enough for brain reading, neither would the state-of-the-art science be today. But what about the future? Can we EVER get to a point where our thoughts can be monitored, discreetly and non-consensually,&nbsp;via brain signals?</p><p>The answer: I don't think so. I doubt we will ever get to a point where any individual can be pulled into a brain recording room and have their private thoughts read by someone else, perhaps our new Big Brother government. But if that WAS possible, it would have some pretty crazy implications on how our brain works. Let me explain.</p><hr /><p><strong>Intra-subject Brain-Reading</strong><br />We are currently getting closer to a particular kind of thought-reading from brain signals: intra-subject decoding. The gist of these experiments is:&nbsp;a subject is instructed to observe many stimuli of the same kind, such as thousands of pictures or soundbites. Meanwhile, their brain signal is recorded, via neuroimaging (fMRI)&nbsp;or electrophysiology (EEG). This procedure generates a dictionary of sort, where a particular pattern of brain activation is mapped one-to-one with a particular image, for example. It's important to use many different stimuli in order to probe the full extent of the brain response.&nbsp;At the same time, however, it would be unnecessary to show them every image imaginable. This is because most types of stimuli, like images, can be deconstructed into some fundamental elements. To give a more intuitive example, there are countless numbers of possible English sentences, but there are way fewer English words. And if we assume that a person's brain reliably responds to individual words differently, then as long as we know the word-to-brain response mapping, it would be possible, theoretically, to reconstruct any sentence they are hearing by piecing together their response word by word. Images work similarly, but instead of smaller, discrete elements, they're decomposed into edges, angles, colors, etc.</p><p>All that is to say, to read someone's thoughts from their brain, we would first need to build up a brain-dictionary that contains all of a person's possible responses. From that point, we can then predict their response to, say, images we haven't shown them. Conversely, by looking at their brain response, it is possible to reconstruct what image they are seeing, even if it's one they've never seen before. Watch this cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FsH7RK1S2E">demo</a>&nbsp;from UC Berkeley.&nbsp;The reconstructed images (or movie), at this point in time, is pretty poor. We can get a gist of what the original movie looks like when they're shown side by side, but as you can see, it's still very blobby. This, however, is likely to improve very rapidly, and is not the main theoretical limitation. Hypothetically, if you had access to every single neuron's activity and enough training examples (e.g., images shown), it's conceivable that one could then get a good rough estimate of somebody's perception and internal thoughts. And voila, we have intra-subject thought-reading.</p><p><strong>Inter-subject Brain-Reading</strong><br />If the above is true, why wouldn't someone then be able to forcibly or discreetly record my brain activity and read my thoughts? The answer, or at least I think, is that the brain-to-thought dictionary is not generalizable across people. In other words, in order to read my thoughts from my brain activity, you would need to make a whole new dictionary, just for me, which requires my active participation. You wouldn't be able to take someone else's brain-dictionary and use that to interpret my thoughts. In technical terms, we say that the representation is not invariant across brains (inter-subject), and that the way information is encoded depends on the substrate that it's encoded on. To give a counter example, writing the same word on different types of paper with different colored pens does not change the information transcribed, at least with regards to the meaning of that word.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, I say "I think" because this is not certain to be an impossibility, but is very unlikely for two reasons. First, our brains are all very different physically, so it's impossible to find common anatomical mappings of the same information between different people. As of right now, we know that, for example, the back of the brain in almost everybody (visual cortex) encodes visual information, so that's in a way invariant. But it would be very difficult to be more precise than that, because there aren't a lot of common landmarks to orient a common decoder. Second, if it turned out that information is represented in the brain not spatially, but temporally, via the exact timing a particular sequence of neurons fire (which we don't know), it is even less likely that a decoder can transfer between two people, because your brain would have to save the appropriate sequence for the appropriate concept, lest you never experience that concept in your life. Given the above, unless someone kidnapped you, strapped you into a brain scanner while feeding you thousands of stimuli while recording your brain response, they will not be able to interpret your thoughts from your brain.&nbsp;So all thought-reading in the future will likely have to be consensual,&nbsp;though they could very well kidnap you...but that's outside the bounds of theory.</p><p><strong>Theoretical Considerations &amp; Implications</strong><br />At the end of the day, this is still a mystery because of a central question: how does a brain -&nbsp;any brain -&nbsp;represent information? Or what is the <a href="http://haxbylab.dartmouth.edu/publications/HCG14.pdf">neural code</a>, as people like to say. As unlikely as I think non-consensual thought-reading is, it does appear that some information IS invariant across different people. For example, most people have tonotopic mapping of sounds, where sounds similar in pitch are represented closer together in the cochlea &amp; auditory cortex.&nbsp;The same is true to an extent for visual information and motion. But I believe this is due to commonality in our experiential world: since all of us see vertical lines all the time,&nbsp;they are then likely to be represented prominently and similarly in our brains, though you will still need to find some landmark to orient two brains to. And as we move to more abstract ideas, such as a particular thought or idea or feeling, it's likely represented differently because we experience them so differently. This implies that, if we had a brain decoder that worked well for several different individuals, then they will have had similar life experiences, at least with respect to the particular concepts or thoughts being decoded. But who knows, maybe there is some genetic program that drives our neural representation to be more similar than we currently understand, or there may really be an universal neural code that we haven't discovered - those are the crazy implications for how our brain works if we were able to realize non-consensual inter-subject decoding in the future.</p><p>Question that I can't answer but I think is analogous: can we decode the software state of a computer, given that we know its hardware architecture, operating system, and have realtime recording of all transistor states in the CPU and memory? My guess is yes, since knowing the OS basically means that we know the mapping of a particular computer. Someone educate me please.</p><hr /><p>Addendum: I found this paper (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25842289">Inter-subject neural code converter for visual image representation</a>)&nbsp;trying to solve the exact problem that I've raised above, translating one person's brain-dictionary to another's. The key here, as I outlined, is that they still need to build both people's dictionaries, and then finding some transformation that maps one person's brain activity onto the other's, for the same stimulus.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>1/52: Challenge Accepted</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/1/5/152-challenge-accepted</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jan 5, 2017</p><p>With the turning of a new calendar, we have reached the beginning of yet another circle around our sun. I'm usually not one to make new year resolutions, because I feel that 1) making something into a new year resolution means that it's almost guaranteed to be broken, and 2) I maintain the philosophy that if I want to do something to improve my life, I would want to start as soon as possible. That's why I'm not calling this activity a "resolution", but a challenge.</p><p>Jokes aside, the idea is very simple: I challenge myself to post a blog article every single week for a whole year. And as the first post of the year, I will talk about why I want to do this (because it will be crazy hard), and how I plan to make this happen (failure to plan is planning for failure!)</p><hr /><p><strong>Why am I doing this?</strong><br />Firstly, writing is now an indispensable part of my professional toolkit as a graduate student. As such, it pays to write as often as possible in order to practice getting to a place where I can write easily and clearly for scientific publications. Since paper writing comes at the end of a successful project, however, a toiling graduate student doesn't have many opportunities to make that happen. On the flip side, I've always enjoyed writing for fun by keeping a blog, but recently I've found myself fall into the trap of "letting perfection become the enemy of good." What that means is that I will typically spend many, many hours writing a blog post, and this is just for the ones that make it out into the sunlight. Many other potential posts are buried somewhere as drafts, some due to my decision halfway through that the topic isn't interesting enough, and some for no other reason than that I've lost steam. As a result, something that is supposed to be fun and creative became laborious, because I too often try to cover all possible angles of approaching a topic, even though it's quite a futile effort and makes for super long blog posts.</p><p>SO, in light of that struggle, I realized that I will need to actively overcome my fear of writing badly and incompletely, and the only way to do that is to write at a rate that I will not possibly be able to keep up with if I were to spend as much time as I do now per post and not be a full-time blog writer. The key heuristic I want to aim for is the 80/20 rule: spend the 20% effort required to make it 80% as good, and move on. Of course, I am deathly afraid that the resulting quality will be so poor that quantity will eventually trump quality, adversely impacting my blog, and I know that as soon as I start to feel this way, I will want to stop. That is why I am publicly announcing this, as it has been my experience that nothing ever gets done unless there is a deadline or someone expects something of me. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do I plan to do this?</strong><br />One blog post per week is difficult, seeing how I averaged about one post every two months or so in the last year. The difficult part for me, however, is not finding something to say. As previously demonstrated <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2016/5/10/on-doing-nothing-at-the-dentists">here</a> and <a href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2015/7/2/redesigning-the-tp">here</a>, I can quite literally write about nothing much at all, because I think a lot of random things are interesting. Instead, the main difficulty for me - and I don't know if I'm the first to coin this term - is that I tend to "edit myself to death." What does this mean? It means that as I write, I tend to re-read the entire thing up to the current point in order to write the next sentence, to make sure that it flows as a part of the whole. Actually, this has been my problem ever since I had to write essays for school. I'm what you would call a first-draft-only kind of person: I would meticulously write and edit and write and edit every sentence as I go, and the whole process would take so long that I would have no time to edit at the end, nor would I want to, because reading everything again for the (N+1)th time would make me sick.</p><p>I really believe that this alone sufficiently stifled my output, and it made things un-fun. So how do I plan to circumvent this? It can be summarized by a single advice: separate the process of creating and critiquing. This means actively stopping myself from reading through the whole thing every few sentence or so, and try to finish the whole piece in one go. This is exactly what I have done up until this point in the post, and I've noticed that, for example, when I'm stuck trying to find a particular suitable word, I will go back and read the whole thing again, for no real good reason. What I find helpful there is to literally just to put a blank placeholder for the word ( ____ ) and come back later to fill it in, in order to not break the flow. Also, I think giving myself a time constraint will be helpful, because I know I will need to produce something at least passable by the end of the writing session, as opposed to having free reign over my time. Hence, I will give myself 2 hours for each post: 30 minutes of planning/research, an hour of actual writing, and 30 minutes of editing and refinement of ideas.&nbsp;Finally, I will try to write less, focusing on only one main idea and use language as concisely as possible., though certainly not all writing should be done this way, such as a novel.</p><p>Post-Mortem: I definitely feel that some ideas were not as well fleshed out or given enough examples for in this post, as I raced to finish the writing portion. But what do you know, an hour later, out came a post. If you're reading this and have also been thinking of keeping a blog, whether just for yourself or for the public eye, I encourage you to start ASAP and get it out there. It's definitely better to have made something kinda good than to not have made anything at all.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to be funny on Yelp: "My wife and I hate this place."</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> if you want to be funny (at least on Yelp), go to the worst restaurants with your significant other (and pet?) and write a deeply personal account of how this traumatic experience has affected your life.</p><hr /><p>Humor is a great way to connect with people, it lets them know that you're probably a charming yet harmless clown, so you can punch them in the spleen while their guard is down *POW* (just kidding). How to be <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FTHSH0UNRHOH/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B008JELLCA">funny</a>, you ask? Well, in our great big world of technology today, how else do we learn, but to let the machines tell us what we want to know. But for machines to learn, it needs lots and lots data, and in our specific case, data about what PEOPLE find funny and what they do not.</p><p><strong>Yelp Dataset</strong></p><p>Enter the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge">Yelp Dataset Challenge</a>. If you're an avid foodie or simply terrible at making your own meal decisions, you would be familiar with Yelp. If you really live under a rock, check it out <a href="http://www.yelp.com/toronto">here</a>. This amazing website aggregates the opinion of many amateur critics of restaurants (and other businesses) so you can spend half an hour getting informed about which taco place is the best instead of just walking down the street like normal people use to do. Nonetheless, some of these reviews are pretty detailed and entertaining, so Yelp decided that they needed reviews to be reviewed (yodawg), via a simple interface a la the vote bar. And this is exactly the data we will use for today's exercise (read: last month's assignment). The Yelp Dataset Challenge provides a million or so reviews, each of which has the full text, as well the number of votes it got in each of the 3 categories: useful, funny, cool. Side note, I totally get why "Useful" is a button, just like Amazon's "helpfulness" vote. But "Funny" and "Cool"? What purpose could these votes possibly serve in informing my decision about the restaurant? Well, one man's useless musing is another man's treasure cove of data. What we will do, then, is to correlate the review text with the funniness vote, and see what kind of text features are most likely judged as funny.</p>

<p><strong>Regressing for Funniness</strong><br />The model I use is nice and simple: (ridge) regression with bag of words (monogram and bigram) features and 4-fold validation. If you're familiar with what these are, or just plain uninterested, skip to the results section. If not, I will give my best attempt to explain what these things are here. Basically, I'm looking for single words and two-2 word phrases that most commonly appear in funny reviews.</p><p><strong>Bag of words</strong>: a bag of words is exactly what it sounds like, you take some text like a restaurant review, and simply count how many times each word occurred in that piece of text. In other words, you toss all the words in a bag, losing its syntax, and just pull the words out one by one and tally when something has occurred. So for example, if "Mary had a little lamb and a big lamb." is our text, then the words "lamb" and "a" would get 2 counts each, whereas the other words all get a 1. If this is too confusing or insufficiently detailed for your taste, check out the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">entry</a>.</p><p>So what usually happens is that you would build a big dictionary of words from all of your text data, i.e. all one million reviews, which will literally be a list like [A, Aardvark, ..., Lamb, ... Mary, ... Zebra], and each review is then represented as a count of how many times each word in the dictionary occurs. So for all the reviews, it would mostly contain zeros because the dictionary probably has upwards of a million words, but each review is only hundreds of words. This means that, given the big dictionary and a particular review's feature vector, we can figure out exactly which words occur (and how many times) in this review, but not the order in which they appear.&nbsp;This is called a monogram feature, because MONO means 1 and we're counting one word at a time. Bigram, as you can guess, is two words at a time, preserving its sequential ordering, so the above example would be [Mary had, had a, a little, little lamb...]. This is the bare minimum attempt at passing some grammar since "good" and "not good" obviously mean very different things, and we'd like to keep that. There are some more tricks that are often applied, such as throwing out punctuations and really common words (stopwords) like "the", "and", "a", etc, as well as limiting the dictionary to only the most commonly seen words. For this analysis, I'm using the 1000 most common monograms and bigrams, after throwing out stopwords,&nbsp;so each review is represented by a list of 2000 numbers.</p><p><strong>Regression</strong>: I will not attempt to teach the concept of regression in one paragraph, instead, I will just explain what the idea is in the context of what we're trying to do here. From before, each review is represented as a list of 2000 numbers, denoting the occurrence of 1000 words and 1000 two-word phrases in each review. In addition, each review has a number representing how funny it is (e.g. the amount of "Funny" votes, and a variation we will later see). The goal of regression is then to correlate a list of words with its funniness, so that when presented with a brand new list (a new review), we can predict how funny it will be. This means that when specific words are present in all the funny reviews and not the un-funny ones, it should get a high "weight" (or "vote") in determining how funny something is. For example, if you performed regression based on how much a 5-year-old laughs at sentences he hears, the word "fart" would probably have an extremely large weight,&nbsp;and "broccoli" would have a very small (or negative) weight. To make sure that the model has general validity (avoid overfitting), 4-fold validation simply means to split the data into quarters, and to train the regression model on 3/4 of the data and test (predict) on the remaining quarter, in order to find the best model in terms of prediction accuracy.&nbsp;<strong>Therefore,&nbsp;</strong><strong>the goal of this exercise is to see which words have the highest weights (in the best model)&nbsp;in regressing for funniness, as learned from the Yelp dataset.</strong></p><p>There are plenty of more sophisticated and possibly more relevant models out there (ALL ABOARD THE DEEP/RECURRENT NET TRAIN CHOOCHOO), but this was sufficient for me passing the course. Plus, I actually really just wanted to see which words and phrases would be deemed funny in this context, throwing away all other information, so that one day if I was restricted to writing and speaking in single words, I don't have to say "fart" all the time to be funny.</p><p><strong>So how to be funny?</strong><br /><strong>1. Everything is funnier when you're popular.</strong><br />As you may recall, how I defined funniness here is how many "Funny" votes a review got. This definition has problems right off the bat. For one, a review is more likely to have more votes the older it is, such that for two reviews of similar objective funniness, the older one will have more votes. We don't want that. Secondly, and more importantly, Yelp has an integrated social network platform, so that reviewers can be friends with other reviewers, which means that reviewers with more connections will get more exposure for their reviews, hence more votes. In a similar vein, Yelp places more helpful/popular reviews near the top of a restaurant's page with their Yelp Sort algorithm, which is great for users but bad for judging funniness because the more exposure a review gets, the more likely it is to be visible, thus more likely to be voted on, and the cycle continues.</p><p>This is bad, because if we tried to learn how funny a review is based on the raw count, and a few of them have WAY more votes (orders of magnitude), then the model will simply ignore the vast majority of the data in favor of these selected few.&nbsp;I don't even need to put these through the regression to know that it will be badly biased by a few reviews with a disproportional amount of votes. How disproportional?</p>

Note the log-log scale."/> Number of reviews with a specified number of votes. Note the log-log scale.[/caption]


<p>Above is a histogram showing how many reviews have a certain number of votes (<strong>NOTE the log-log scale.</strong>&nbsp;e.g. 1000 reviews have 10 Funny votes, about 100 has 20). Histograms are usually drawn with bars, but it's ugly on a log-log scale, and the idea is the same,&nbsp;the line just connects where the top of the bars would have been. Anyway, what this shows is that a small number of reviews have a LOT of votes compared to the vast majority (less than 10 votes), which creates the problem I described above.&nbsp;Worse yet, the "funny" reviews are probably not that funny,&nbsp;because <strong>the pairwise correlation between each pair of the 3 categories are 0.73, 0.80, and 0.84,&nbsp;meaning that what's voted as funny by lots of people is also likely to be voted as useful and cool</strong>.&nbsp;This means that what's voted as funny is not simply due to the review's own merit, but more likely it's popularity. In other words, just by looking at how many total votes (or any of the non-funny votes) a review has, I can predict how many funny votes it got. I proclaim this to be the most profound lesson of the day: kids, it's (probably) good to be popular.&nbsp;Now, you could reasonably argue that what's popular is rightfully more funny than what no one cares to read, in which case you were probably popular in high school and I would object by referring you to the first and last seasons of How I Met Your Mother.</p><p>To counter these issues, I calculate a F-Index (creative naming, I know), which is simply calculated as F-Index =&nbsp;(Funny - (Cool+Useful)/2). In plain English, the F-Index measures how much more do people perceive a review as funny than useful and cool. This is a simple way to normalize by popularity, so to speak, as well as shrinking the gap of funniness. As an example,&nbsp;imagine two reviews with votes [1,7,3] and [100,102,98] (for [cool, funny, useful] ), if we just used the raw votes, the second review would be considerably more funny than the first (7 vs. 102). But if we take the F-Index, they would have 7-(1+3)/2 = 5 and 3 respectively, which means that the first is actually funnier. This appeals to intuition because if people are reading these reviews and actively decide to cast their votes in Funny only, then it should be considered funny, no matter how many total votes it has. This, of course, biases against reviews that are truly as funny as they are useful (and cool, whatever that means), but hey, I had to hand in something.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Be polarizing, personal...and suffer with your spouse</strong><br />Now that I have a metric that I'm happy with, I can just churn the data through the model. If you're wondering, I'm using Python. I was going to upload the code on GitHub, then I realized that it is so poorly written that it would seriously put a dent on the probability of me ever getting a professional coding job, and I am nowhere near motivated enough to actually clean it up. Nevertheless, if for whatever reason you're interested in the iPython Notebook code, message me and I will gladly share.</p><p>Here comes the big reveal...drumroll!</p>

<p>Above are 50 unigrams/bigrams that are the most associative of a review's funniness (positively,&nbsp;blue; negatively, red, 25 each), i.e.,&nbsp;this set of words tend to appear in reviews that are the most/least funny.</p><p>The results are quite interesting, just by seeing which words come out on top. Out of 25, 6 of them connote some kind of extreme negativity (rude, won't be, will never [return], worst, terrible, horrible), whereas none appeared in the least funny reviews. I can buy this: anecdotally, people usually laugh at self-deprecating jokes (which might be hard to do on a restaurant review) or extraordinary complaints, so going to a shitty restaurant and then writing about it might have a good chance of making someone laugh. On the flip side, "incredible" and "excited" connote positive responses, so it appears that not only do very bad experiences make for funny stories, but good ones as well (though less so). Other things of note: owner/owners are apparently funny words in the right context, probably referring to a rude owner. Also, my wife/wife and/my boyfriend also placed in the top 25, so it appears that taking your significant other at a time of suffering is humorous. Although, you can see that both "wife" and "boyfriend" appear in the bottom 25 words - how does this make sense? One possibility is that those refer to someone else's boyfriend and wife, but that feels like a bit of a stretch. Deeper analysis is required here, my guess is that it's due to the regression balancing the weights on what is only sometimes funny. In general, though, it seems that the least funny words are rarely descriptive (adjectives), which by nature makes them neutral (with the exception of, possibly, "highly recommend") and also impersonal. So, it appears that the takeaway is to be polarizing and subjective in your reviews, and involve your loved ones (wife and dogs, apparently).</p><p><strong>3. Be honest</strong><br />As we discovered above, extremely good and bad experiences seem to make for a good laugh, so what if we take that into consideration in our model? To do that, I simply added two more features into the 2000-dimension vector,&nbsp;the restaurant rating and rating squared, and the regression will take care of it automatically. This means that we don't need to depend on the sentiment of the phrases to tell us about the experience anymore, and so there may be more informative words that will appear after having accounted for it. Indeed, the regression weights for the dimension representing rating (and squared) were much higher (not shown) than any of the subsequent weights representing unigram/bigram features, which means that, as we predicted, the funniness of a review is firstly a function of the rating it gave out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having accounted for the quality of the experience, we can take a look at how the weights of the most correlative words/phrases changed. The most striking change, I think, is the downgraded importance of bad adjectives, where "rude" was the only one from before that still remained in the top 25, though its weight significantly decreased. This means that, having accounted for the quality of the restaurant experience, these extreme adjectives are not so helpful in judging funniness anymore, because they mostly convey the same information. Also, this means that simply being harsh is not enough to be funny. Or rather, no one in their right mind describes a treacherous experience but gave it a good star rating, at least in this dataset. We can't really say much about whether simply being critical would be funny, i.e., when the words are inconsistent with the rating, and the average rating of the restaurant,&nbsp;but that's a good experiment someone else should do. Aside from the bad adjectives, the other top-weighted words largely remain unchanged, which suggests that they are independent of the quality of experience.</p><p><strong>End Note</strong><br />This whole exercise is obviously correlational, meaning I'm not promising that if you write a scathing review of your neighborhood bad eats, it will be perceived as funny, though the trend on Yelp suggests that it might, so take from it what you will. Also, the analysis has many caveats and assumptions, uses an extremely simple model, and throws away a lot of information (namely, syntactical) to arrive at this conclusion. Given all that, however, it is a little surprising that somebody in an academic setting has previously published a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/244/mihalcea.cicling07.pdf">paper</a> describing exactly these findings. In attempting to automatically classify full-length articles (news &amp; the Onion) as serious or humorous, these folks found that the overwhelming majority of humorous articles 1) contain negative sentiment and 2) are more human-centered [1]. Again, a computer science paper and my hacked-together project do not give definitive answers on what is funny, but seeing how they agree with each other and with our intuition, I think it's interesting that there is at least a vague sense of generalizability on what we think to be funny or not.</p><p>[1] Mihalcea &amp; Pulman.&nbsp;https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/244/mihalcea.cicling07.pdf</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>San Antonio: A Tale of Two Spurs</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/29/the-evolution-of-the-san-antonio-spurs</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The San Antonio Spurs (SAS) became the NBA Champions, for the 5th time in the Duncan Era (1997/98-Present), on June 15, 2014. It was full of beautiful and heartwarming storylines: from the revenge of last year's loss, to the Big Three + Pop riding into the sunset (again), to the rise of Sugar K. Kawhi Leonard, and no less, to the implosion of the Miami Heat prior to the impending free agency of their own Big 3.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The biggest storyline, however, is the way the Spurs surgically dissected the Heat on offense, especially in the final 3 of the 5 games. The Spurs played with such precision, flow, and effortlessness- it was just beautiful team basketball. After all the dust settled, I suddenly remembered: "wait...I thought Spurs were the most snore-inducing NBA team of the 21st century?" To my credit, I definitely wasn't the only person that thought this; and to everyone's credit, it was true. I started seriously following NBA basketball from 2003/04, when the Pistons ended the Kobe-Shaq Laker dynasty in the 2004 Finals, for good. The following year, I was rooting for the Pistons to repeat, but in came the Spurs again to what I remember was a VERY slow Finals (albeit the Pistons weren't particularly entertaining either, except Sheed). This was true for a long time: the Spurs were simply too slow and scoring too little to be fun. And suddenly, it wasn't. So here is the question of the day: <strong>just how did the San Antonio Spurs so drastically change their identity, from a defensive juggernaut, to what we saw in this year's Finals- a smooth-running offensive engine?</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To answer this question, I took it upon myself to sift through Spur's data from the past 16 seasons, going all the way back to 1998/99: the first of the 5 championships. All data were taken from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.basketball-reference.com">www.basketball-reference.com</a> and analyzed/visualized in MATLAB (yes, I know it's not very pretty, sue me). Click on figures to enlarge.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>First Glance: Offensive &amp; Defensive Ratings per 100 Possessions</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To get an overall picture of the team identity in the past 16 seasons, we can take a look at the Pace and Off/Def rating numbers. For those that are unfamiliar with these stats: Pace is the average number of possessions a team uses per game, meaning, some teams play very fast, scoring but also giving up a lot of points in a game, and vice versa. Offensive/Defensive rating, then, is points scored/points given up per 100 possessions, i.e. (points per game)/(pace). This allows us to evaluate teams on an equal footing, since a team that scores 80 points in 80 possessions is much more efficient than one that scores 100 points in 120 possessions. Defensive prowess is adjusted in the same fashion in order to evaluate just how stingy a defense is.</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1198.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/53b0a4b8e4b07bdcd67b8ae1/1404085433583//img.jpg" alt="Figure 2. SAS Relative Per 100% Ratings"/> Figure 2. SAS Relative Per 100% Ratings[/caption]


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Figure 1 shows SAS offensive (red) &amp; defensive (blue) ratings, and pace (black), in comparison to the league average rating (dashed pink) and pace (dashed black), from 1999 to 2014 (vertical lines mark SAS championship years). Interesting side note: on average, the league scores as many points as it gives up, as indicated by the fact that there aren't two separate rating numbers for offensive and defensive efficiency. I don't know why this wasn't immediately obvious to me, since the whole league can't be scoring more points than it's giving up, but it's cool nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking at this graph, we can clearly see in the numbers what we observed on TV: from 1999 to 2009, SAS was consistently below league average in possessions per game (Pace). This is exacerbated by its barely-above-average offensive efficiency, and its penny-pinching defense (check out that huge gap between pink and blue). What does this mean? It means the Spurs played slowly, scored infrequently, and allowed opponents to score even more infrequently, i.e. sleep-inducing basketball. Everyone appreciates good team defense, it's just... nobody really enjoys watching it. I remember reading that the 2007 Finals had one of the worst TV ratings for NBA Finals [1], and guess who won? See the vertical line. A small part of me thinks that David Stern went to the Spurs that year and left a phone message like this:</p><blockquote>"Congratulations on the championship Pop! I know you guys are a world-class organization and will continue to win rings for years to come, but you're killing the NBA business. So how about we sponsor you for the next 5 years, giving you honorary NBA Championships, and you take that time to reinvent yourselves to be more TV-friendly? OH and we'll make churros the official NBA food? Yeah? Yeah."</blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ...The rest was history. You can see that, starting in 2008, SAS Pace steadily rose until it became above average in 2011, while scoring more points and also giving up more. How much more? Figure 2 shows SAS ratings relative to league average (SAS rating minus league rating). The thin horizontal line marks 0, i.e. league average. We observe almost the same things here, but more magnified. It's remarkable to see that, from 2008, SAS steadily worked on increasing their Pace and OffRtg every year, whereas the DefRtg got worse probably as a by-product of the faster pace- until 2012, when Pop probably felt that the team was losing their defensive identity. He brought them back down to Earth, was 6 seconds away from another ring, readjusted their game this season to bring the offense up a tick more while maintaining the same defensive efficiency...and Bob's your uncle: 2014 NBA Champs. At this point,&nbsp;I have a hypothesis as to why this shift occurred, but I'll keep that to myself till the end.&nbsp;One more note of interest: during the first 4 championships (1999-2007), the Old Spurs maintained almost the same net rating (offensive minus defensive, green), scoring more than their opponent by a consistent margin. The New Spurs struggled to find themselves in the beginning, marked by a large dip in 2008, and slowly climbed its way back to peak in net efficiency this year. There's so much more to be seen here, like the micro-adjustment between 03 and 05, but I'll try to stay on topic. This is like a math nerd's dream come true.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>: Tale of two Spurs- Old Spurs (pre-2008) played slower, scored less but gave up less, while New Spurs played faster and scored more. Both Spurs maintained roughly the same point differentials.<br /> </p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Shooting Numbers In Detail: Spurs' Evolution Precedes the League's</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Having identified the general trend, as well as the change of identity in 2008, we can take a closer look at both the offensive and defensive numbers in detail, to see where all this extra points came from. Figures 3 and 4 below display the Field Goal (FG) and Freethrow (FT) numbers over the same years, compared to league average. For our non-basketball friends: a field goal includes any kind of shot other than freethrows, i.e. shots that occurred during the regular flow of the game.&nbsp;The insets are as follows: left-FG made, middle-FG attempted, right-FG%.&nbsp;These stats are usually calculated as "per game" stats, thus not accounting for pace. I've gone ahead and adjusted both SAS and league average stats to be per 100 possession, getting rid of any possible contamination in cases such as, for example, a team making more field goals simply because it had more possessions, and making a fair comparison between SAS and league. The adjustment is not applicable for the percentage stat.</p>

SAS vs. League Freethrow Stats"/> Figure 4. SAS vs. League Freethrow Stats[/caption]


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In Figure 3, you can, once again, clearly distinguish the transformation of the Spurs, which actually came a bit before the 07 title. Old Spurs made as many field goals as the league on average, but attempted much less. As such, we can conclude that their offense, while slow, was still efficient (above average FG%), and their defense held opponents to below average. They were probably much more prone to turnovers since 15-20 possessions in 100 did not result in a shot attempt. The New Spurs was another beast, especially after 08, which attempted roughly the same amount of field goals as the league, but made them at a much higher clip, further increasing their field goal percentage. How does a team attempt more shots per possession? By moving the ball quickly and accurately while minimizing turnovers. I believe an offensive rebound generates a second possession in the stats (correct me?), so an increase in offensive rebounds should not impact the shots per possession stats. Note that the league as a whole didn't change how much it shot, but became more efficient. Figure 4 shows freethrows per 100 possession, and you can see that both SAS and the league shot less freethrows as the years went on, but while the league maintained its FT%, SAS improved drastically after 06. In addition, SAS went from shooting 3 more, per100poss, in 1999 to 4 less, compared to the league. Freethrows usually come from contested shots in the paint, hmm....</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Seeing how SAS began to attempt and make more field goals, we might ask where these field goals came from, and we have the answers in Figures 5 and 6, showing 2-Point and 3-Point FGs made, attempted, and percentage. Again, these are adjusted to Pace. First, we can notice a league-wide phenomenon, which is that 2-Point shots are attempted less and less, while teams are making them at a higher percentage. At the same time, 3-Point percentage was pretty much constant over the 16 year span, but teams became much happier to shoot the 3 ball, seeing an increase of 9 attempts per 100 possessions. This is consistent with what's now known as "the Death of the Midrange Jumper", otherwise known as the Houston Rockets Offense: Layups and 3s. Basically, the philosophy is to shoot more 3s, hopefully efficiently enough, because they give you 1.5X points per shot. Seeing how the difference of a foot in and a foot out of the 3-point arc can give you 50% more points, teams are getting smarter so that they stop shooting longer 2s and just stepping out to shoot the 3. This isn't groundbreaking news, but what's interesting is that SAS adopted this strategy much earlier than the rest of the league: the OLD Old Spurs attempted the same number of 2s as the league but made a LOT more, while attempting and making less 3s than average. Circa 2003, they traded away a sizable portion of their 2P attempts, though maintaining or improving their 2P%, for 3P attempts. Finally, we see that, in 2014, SAS is attempting just under the league average for both the 2 and 3, but making almost two more 2s and one more 3 per 100 possessions. All in all, between 1999 and 2014, SAS is shooting about 8 less 2s (making 2 less) and 10 more 3s (making 5 more). Their 2P is so incredibly efficient in 2014, which we saw in the Finals, probably due to all those extra passes.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>: Old Spurs attempted less field goals, particularly the 3, and more free throws, but were great at making their 2P shots. New Spurs shot more altogether, seeing a decrease in attempted 2s for 3s, but were still making an incredible amount of their 2-Point attempts.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Support Stats: Proverbial Nail in the Coffin</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The offensive/defensive ratings told us that the Spurs became a faster team and scored more baskets, while the field goal stats shed some insight on how the Spurs were getting their points then and now. So finally, we'll take a look at the Spurs' rebounding, assists, and other support stats in the 16-year period. Once again, the numbers are adjusted to Pace, so they represent per 100 possession stats.</p>

Spurs vs. League Defensive Categories"/> Figure 8. Spurs vs. League Defensive Categories[/caption]


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; First, we'll take a look at the offensive categories (Figure 7): offensive rebounding, assists, and turnovers. The highlight here should be obvious: SAS went from an average/slightly above average assist team, to become a passing machine, beginning in 2009. Assists numbers rose steadily from 09 to 14, resulting in 3 more assists per 100 possessions. In fact, the Spurs has been number one in the league in assists per game for the past two years [2]. Coupled with the high field goal percentage, as well as a slightly higher pace, this combination handily explains the Spurs rise to offensive dominance. In addition, we see in the turnover numbers that, indeed, the Old Spurs were only league average or worse in holding onto the ball, resulting in less shots per possession, whereas they've made a conscious effort to cut down on the TO numbers, noting the dramatic decrease starting in 2008. It's interesting to note that the league as a whole has been taking care of the ball better, though. Finally, we see that their emphasis on crashing the offensive boards decreased over the years as well, except for between 2010-2012. I wonder who used to crash all their misses?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the flip side, Figure 8 looks at the defensive categories: defensive rebounding, steals, and blocks. We can observe that SAS has consistently been a great defensive rebounding team, and consistently being league average in steals, except for a drop-off between 2008-2010. The drop in steals may or may not have been an experiment in a more disciplined defensive philosophy, though I doubt they had problems in that department prior to then. They did, however, lose Bruce Bowen in 2008 I believe. The final, and most drastic change we can observe on defense, is the blocks stat: steadily decreasing from 7.5 per 100 possessions in 2005, to 4.5 in 2009, and finally recovering to above average in 2013 and 2014. With that, I am convinced of my initial hypothesis on the reason why the Spurs had to change.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaway</strong>: Spurs' offensive and defensive philosophy changed in the mid-2000s. They became a great passing team and took better care of the ball, crashed the offensive boards less, and blocked much less shots.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>San Antonio Spurs: Master of Father Time</strong></p>

Tim Duncan's and Tony Parker's Minutes Per Game"/> Figure 10. Tim Duncan's and Tony Parker's Minutes Per Game[/caption]


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I believe the above two graphs explain most, if not all, of San Antonio's shift in identity. To the left, the bar graph displays the Spurs' rank in the league in terms of average player age, 1st being oldest and 30th being youngest. You'll see that for 4 years in a row (2005/06-2008/09), the Spurs were the oldest team in the NBA. Amazingly, they won a championship in the 06/07 season, but their steady decline due to age wasn't purely imagination of the public. To alleviate this age issue, specifically, the age issue of one particular player, the Spurs had to change it up. To the right, the line graph shows Tim Duncan's (black) and Tony Parker's (red) average playing time, over the 16 seasons. To put it in perspective, Timmy is playing 12 minutes less in 2014 compared to his peak in 2002, which is an entire quarter's worth of playing time. For comparison, you can see that TeePee's playing time didn't drop off quite as dramatically. This changes everything:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Tim Duncan wasn't the most mobile person, even in his prime, compared to guys that would hop around a lot, like KG. As such, during the early 2000s, the Spurs primarily went to Duncan in the low- to mid-post for a post up or face up shot (I don't have the advanced stats for this, but I don't think anyone will throw their hands up in disbelief over that last statement.), hence the larger number of two point shots, as well as a slower offense, for the Old Spurs. However, as Pop started to manage Tim's minutes heavily, Spurs must do without their primary and most reliable post scorer for a third of the time they usually get, especially without a suitable substitute. This meant that the offense cannot run through the TD-post-up, and while Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili (GINOBILIIIII!) were all-stars - superstars even - in their own rights, they just weren't the 30-points-a-night kind of guards like a Chris Paul or a Dwyane Wade, which meant that there had to be a more sophisticated system on offense.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The final two figures display Tim Duncan's shooting numbers (left) and Reb/Ast/Blk (right). The black lines mark his per game number, whereas the blue lines are his stats normalized to per 40 minutes. These figures suggests that we should give Timmy a new nickname: Mr. Linearity. Both his shots attempted and shots made are proportional to his playing time, as his near constant minute-adjusted shooting stats indicate. Similarly, his rebounding is also constant per-40 minutes, whereas his assists actually increased marginally over the years, plus a surge in block numbers in the past few years. I don't know what is the more amazing thing here: Tim Duncan's agelessness in 17 years, or Pop's ability to squeeze JUST the right amount of work out of Timmy, or both?&nbsp;</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>The Unsurprising Conclusion</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you told me at the beginning of this whole investigation that the Spurs were old and that Tim Duncan was a legend, I would have said something like, "what, did you just learn how to read the paper?" I really didn't know what to expect as I first started digging, and I wrote more as I dug further. All I knew was that the Spurs looked a lot better on TV now than they did 6 or 7 years ago, but I wasn't really sure if that was just a product of Miami imploding or god-knows-what. So it's really interesting for me to see that 1) yes, the numbers agree with the observation, and more amazingly, 2) while we've been saying all these years that the Spurs were too old and writing them off year after year, Pop and the whole organization went ahead and tossed the old Spurs out the window, with the foresight that one day, Tim alone would not be enough to win championships. This serves as a direct contrast in the way Miami is riding LeBron to death this year, maybe he should sign with the Spurs this coming season (hah).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Honestly though: the Spurs getting too old 6 seasons ago was the reason why the Spurs won the title this year. Isn't that something? Granted, they got their fair share of good luck in drafting Tony, Manu, and more recently, Kawhi Leonard, as well as the revitalization of the likes of Danny Green and Boris Diaw. But as the saying goes, good luck happens to hard working people. I don't know what could be more unlucky than losing out on a title while being 6 seconds away, but hey, in the end, everything worked out. Thanks for reading, this was really fun.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Post-Analysis Thoughts</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; First of all, none of this analysis had any statistical backing. Really, it was me looking at lines and judging what correlated with and *gasp* caused what. So, you know, don't get too serious about it, I'll even pass along the polished dataset for anyone interested. I do wish that I had some more advanced metrics to actually give a mechanism for the Spurs' quicker and more efficient offense, other than the explanation that they had to do it because Tim's old. Also, I wanted to run some more sophisticated (read:any) analysis tools...well, I did give linear regression a try, and it didn't turn out to be much more useful than my naked eye. A legitimate caveat of this analysis is that for the field goal and category stats, they are 82-game average stats, adjusted to 82-game average pace, instead of stats averaged to pace per game, then averaged over 82 games. These two routes usually give extremely similar results, especially in a rather large sample size. However, the effect of averaging the average (our case) is that it will erase some of the outliers that would have been present if the stats were adjusted per game, which is less accurate but smooths things out a bit, so we like that.&nbsp;</p><p class="text-align-center">_____</p><p>[1]&nbsp;http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2007/news/story?id=2905923</p><p>[2]&nbsp;http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAS/stats_per_game.html</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>3 Essential Apps for Backpacking Europe (and more)</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/8/27/3-essential-apps-for-backpacking</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This post is exactly as the title says: 3 tremendously helpful apps (plus a few honorable mentions) that I used on a daily basis throughout my journey in Europe. I'm writing about this because I'm yet again procrastinating on my trip documentation, but also because I believe they are quite handy. Some of these will prove useful even if you're traveling outside of Europe, I just hope this doesn't turn into a "best apps in Richard's life" kind of thing...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Before you read another word, though, I must preface this by saying that some of these apps are useful mostly on the basis that you do not need to have cellular data in the country of your travels. Because if you do, the internet (&amp;Google) is your friend - your best friend. If you're like me, though, which is somebody not willing to shell out the bucks to get the mobile data, but also actively trying to unplug and only go to my phone when absolutely necessary, then you're in the right place. That being said, these apps should still be useful and convenient, just not nearly as much so as they would be if you were disconnected. So, without further ado, here is my hall of fame of travel apps.</p><hr /><h1>#1: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikisherpa.com/">Wikisherpa</a></h1><p>Available on both iOS and Android.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In case you didn't know, Wikipedia has many distant but equally accomplished relatives, one of which being the invaluable Wikitravel (http://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page). This website is where you would go if you don't want to buy and carry a 200-page travel guidebook for each of your destinations, i.e. when backpacking through many places. As far as I was concerned, it has all the information that you could possibly want about a city: getting in and out, history, attractions, food, transportation, danger zones, plus more. I've never actually used Lonely Planet, but I imagine Wikitravel to be a poor man's version of LP, which is not to say that it's worse since it's based on community contribution.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So why am I writing about this "Wikisherpa" app if Wikitravel is so great? Well, Wikisherpa is an app that lets you download Wikitravel articles for a particular place, and save it for later use - OFFLINE. Of course, it's not simply a gateway for the downloading of Wikitravel, since there is an (extremely minimalist) user interface with some dropdown menus for accessing your saved pages. Although it might even be a bit generous to call it an user interface (and even then it becomes buggy sometimes), it's really all you need: some menus that enable you to find a city, and read up on a particular aspect of it, quickly and data-free. In addition, it has some other features (map, photo spot?, etc) that I never used, mainly because it required data, but you're welcome to explore these features at your leisure.</p><img src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/3TwuEaJkHR4ovr4KXwwcNVXq7Dy8hPtJGVF4PZtjMelwvO2wyfYdgBumfgs2VWng4kqB=h900-rw" title="" alt="WikiSherpa - screenshot"/><p>Sauce: Wikisherpa app in Google Playstore</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of the things I found really useful: museum hours &amp; price, money-saving tips like city pass, transportation tips like whether a day-pass is worth it in certain cities, brief history of the city, local customs, food to try, and getting to the city center from airports/train stations/sea ports. Did I already mention this was all data-free as long as I had downloaded the page beforehand, meaning that I can spend my idle time on the train to read up on the next city? I'm not saying that this is the be-all-end-all of travel guide apps, but if you were to only use one app, this one's got my seal of approval.</p><h1>#2: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hostelworld.com/mobile-app">Hostelworld</a></h1><p>Available on both iOS and Android</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; One word to describe my experience with this app: seamless.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Did you want to know more? Well, if you're a budget traveler whose priority isn't necessarily 4-star lodging, then hostels are your friends, which also means, Expedia is to be avoided like the plague. Not knocking on Expedia, but they are just geared towards a different income bracket. If you're reading this article, though, it probably means that I won't need to sell you on hostels.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The quality of the Hostelworld app comes in two forms: the database, and the app itself. Let's talk about the database first. A quick Google query of the term "hostel" brings you about half a dozen hostel-booking websites that all look to be very impressive, one of which is hostelworld.com. Now, I haven't used any of the other websites at all, so I can't just shit on them. But what I can say is that the database at Hostelworld is more than sufficient during my trip. Considering that I was in Europe during peak travel season, it's pretty amazing that I was able to find a cheap, quality hostel with quality (and abundant) reviews in every case except one, of the 15 or so cities I visited, no earlier than the night before. Maybe this speaks to the quantity of hostels in Europe, as it may be different in other destinations (or if you want female-only rooms or suites), but it certainly has something to do with the completeness of HW's database as well. While I'm on the topic of reviews, I always stayed at hostels with &gt;75% ratings. Usually these ratings consider a combination of factors such as price, service, cleanliness, and location, and I can say that, after having seen all the hostels I stayed at, the reviews are almost always fair, accurate, and on the same standard across cities.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The second aspect, the app itself, is what gets this app the super-bonus-brownie-points in my books. As I said before, the whole experience was seamless. From the initial search to the final booking, deposit payment, and confirmation, it shouldn't take more than 30 seconds, plus no more than 3 minutes to easily browse through the hostel selections after applying some very useful filters (price, rating, etc). All you need is to sign up for a free account and enter a preferred payment method, and the rest is automatically taken care of once you log into the app (it should be obvious at this point that this app DOES require an internet connection, so book ahead while you have WiFi, or go to the nearest McD). It sounds like that I'm either being paid by the company to advertise for them, or that I'm a caveman inexperienced with any sort of booking programs. Well, I may be the latter but definitely not the prior. To prove that I'm not being paid by them, I will cite my single negative experience: for whatever reason, the app automatically sets your check-in date to tomorrow at the time of your booking, even if you entered today when you are checking for availability (not sure if this is a one-off bug or an intended feature). Having glanced over that, I booked my London hostel on the morning of the day that I was set to arrive in, but mistakenly for the night after. Luckily, I was scanning for cheaper hostels after I'd already booked my first one, and realized that I'd be homeless for the first night when I checked my confirmation for price. But yeah,&nbsp;I'm literally blown away by the fact that I can use this thing every other day for a month and have no complaints about it, I can't even really say that about my calculator app.</p><h1>#3: Rail Planner Eurail/InterRail&nbsp;</h1><p>Available on <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/rail-planner-offline-timetable/id579547877?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.eurail&amp;hl=en">Android</a>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I mentioned this in my travel debrief (see this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2014/8/9/rgaoeu2014-aftermath">post</a> for my experience with the European trains and the Eurail Pass), but train experiences varied greatly depending on the country I was in, as well as the type of train I took (international, inter-regional, regional, etc). Regardless of the actual train rides, though, this app was very helpful and it was actually easy to use. And, again, the biggest pro for it is that it doesn't require internet connection for its schedule. Essentially, it's a book of train schedules made into an app (lol).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The caveat is that, obviously, given that it's operational offline, it is not updated to the minute. In fact, the app updates every month or so which in effect updates the schedule, if there are any changes. I've really had no problem because of this, since even the regional trains operate on to-the-minute scheduling (this isn't your regular TTC train), and there are actually printed schedules in most big station that detail the journey of each train, which is exactly what you would be holding in your hands. And when a delay does occur, it's usually by no more than 10-15 minutes, and the connecting legs are sometimes accommodating enough to wait, IF it's a big enough train.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the app includes additional details about the train such as the depart/arrival time, whether the particular train requires reservation, whether there's food, etc. Basically, everything except how much it costs. The interface is once again extremely simple and thus easy to use: find your origin/destination, find a time, and it displays all the trains of your choosing around that time. Oh yeah, that's the great thing - you don't have to go back and re-pick your time, it just displays the subsequent ones for you. Ah technology. Highly recommended if you are depending on accurate train information (offline) during any part of your journey.</p><hr /><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Honorable Mentions</strong></p><h1>Google Maps</h1><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Even though everyone uses Maps, there are two extremely useful features that are must-knows for anyone traveling abroad (or anywhere). First, is the ability to save an area of a map for offline use. Maps saved this way give you the same zoomable resolution as if you were connected to the internet, though you won't be able to view through Streetview, nor can you do a search in the search bar. I need to stress that this is different from taking a screenshot of the current map you're on, as it actually allows you to zoom in and out. Google is constantly thinking of new ways to confuse me by moving this feature around, though it is always there. In previous versions of the app, you type "ok google" (or was it "ok maps"..) and it will give you the option to save the currently displayed area of the map, after adjusting the zoom and pan as you see fit. Currently, at least on my phone, you can tap the search bar in Maps, and on the bottom of the new menu there should be an option to "Save maps for offline use". In case they change it yet again, you can always ask Google "how to save maps for offline use"...prior to losing your internet connection of course. In addition to saving the map, you can look up addresses beforehand (data required) and star them, which will then allow you to find them after you've disconnected.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The second bonus feature is probably more widely known, which is GPS tracking without network connection, i.e. you can find yourself on Maps even if you have zero connectivity (airplane mode), as well as your current heading (a bit iffy). Coupled with the saved map, this means you will NEVER be lost again. Gone are the days when you need to look up for street signs then down at your map constantly while searching for a landmark. To be honest, this feels like I'm cheating life a bit, but I ain't complainin' (try navigating out of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Venice,+Italy/@45.4391267,12.3307592,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x477eb1daf1d63d89:0x7ba3c6f0bd92102f">Venice</a>&nbsp;with a dead map...and streets with no names).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I do want to make a special note about using Google Maps, which is this: DO NOT blindly follow the Transit directions given by Maps. A lot of the times, it will take some obscure route or ignore perfectly valid transportation options like the subway, to get you somewhere in twice the time and effort it should have taken.&nbsp;</p><p> </p><h1>My Tracks</h1><p><a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.maps.mytracks&amp;hl=en">Android Only</a><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Prior to finding out that Google automatically <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/13326/20140818/google-maps-knows-where-youre-going-and-where-youve-been.htm">tracks</a> my movements throughout the day anyway (gee, thanks BigG), I used this app to record paths of particular interest on a day that I walked a lot. I believe it's designed as a fitness trainer app that tracks your run (and calorie burned), but essentially, it pulls your GPS data at a specified frequency (anywhere between 1s-30min), recording your positions and elevation, from which your velocity is calculated. You can then review your course overlaid on Maps, or import it to your Google Drive and viewed on your computer, which is a pretty cool souvenir for myself after a <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8m3IH-iogt-c1BYVHBHa1h5elU/edit?usp=sharing">climb</a> in the Swiss alps. This is not an "essential" app, I just like it recording useless things that I will never look at again. I still use this in favor of Google's automatic location reporting, because the sampling interval is a lot shorter and it has some extra information, but beware that this IS a bit of a battery drainer.</p><p> </p><h1>Phrasebook</h1><p>Available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/phrasebook-learn-multiple/id450181262?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bravolang.phrasebook&amp;hl=en">Android</a></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Offline access for common phrases in multiple languages. I didn't use this as much as I thought I would have needed to (yay for Anglification), though it did come in handy a few times. Just beware that you MAY sound like a total loon reading from Google Translate.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; That's all folks! I SWEAR I'm going to start writing about the actual trip itself, though at this point I don't think anybody cares anymore, except future Richard whenever he decides to feel all nostalgic.&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, here are some useful websites:</p><p>http://www.backpackeurope.com/<br />http://wikitravel.org/en/Main_Page<br />http://www.hostelworld.com/<br />http://thesavvybackpacker.com/<br />https://www.ricksteves.com/</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nothing a short Google search won't get ya, but I personally found them very helpful in the planning and execution of my trip.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, it goes without saying that if you have any questions or comments about anything I wrote or didn't write about, feel free to send a message through the message/comment box I've yet to set up...or just use Facebook/Twitter/IG.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Cheerios!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>RGAO|EU2014: Prologue</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/8/10/rgaoeu2014-prologue</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; After it's all over, the first and only question that crosses your mind is:</em></p><p class="text-align-center"><em>"Was all of it real?"</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; It's a natural question, after all. The only thing that seems to change between then and now is that you're driving away from the airport, not towards. And even with thousands of photos and pages of notes serving as proof, you can never quite shake the feeling that it was but an elaborate dream, a story of a life time with a single spectator...</em></p><hr /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For as long as I can remember, falling asleep on a moving vehicle has been as easy as breathing, if not easier. Cars, buses, trains, planes, whatever. As long as I'm sitting, I'm sleeping.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Not this time.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Buckled in my seat and squished between two strangers that looked equally uncomfortable as me, for the first time in my life, I couldn't fall asleep on a plane ride. I had requested an aisle seat, because I have a small bladder and why interact with two people when you can interact with just one? Alas, I had decided to give that up just before take-off for a family that had somehow been broken up. Up until then, the flight attendant was quite perplexed as to how to deal with their request to be moved together. Well, this was as good of a chance as any for me to validate my brilliant decision of travelling alone. My good deed didn't go unnoticed, however, as the flight attendant that I voluntarily relieved graciously bumped me up to "Option Plus", which entailed a baby bottle of champagne, some extra snacks, and a free blanket. All of that, though, was not enough to redeem the lack of on-flight entertainment system, on the one ride that I needed it the most.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Flying never bothered me, probably because I've always been sleeping. But this time, it somehow dawned on me that I'm stuck in a tin capsule 30000ft in the air. What was more distressing, however, was that I didn't have a fucking clue what I was gonna do for 4 weeks, or how I'm even gonna do it. It wasn't the foreign soil that scared me, but more the foreign concept of complete freedom, a concept that I mistakenly took to be "too many decisions I'll have to make". It was either anxiety or excitement, and I'm not quite sure where the distinction lies. On top of all that, I already started to miss my family, friends, and girlfriend. It seems ridiculous that you can preemptively miss someone knowing only how long you won't see them for, but yeah, you can. And I don't know if it's because Mei was heading for Africa the day after and that I subconsciously feared that I may never see her again, but it literally felt like I was parting with some kind of treasure, my life savings or something.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Artificial separation," I thought, "this is what I wanted, right?" Right. I was for some reason convinced that being scared meant that I was doing the right thing, and that voluntarily distancing myself from everything I had become so familiar with - my house, friends, parents, her, my "life" - will make me appreciate everything more when I came back. "You don't know what you've got till it's gone" is one of the few sayings that I buy into, and have had some experience with. So I figured, why wait till it's actually gone? Why don't I voluntarily go away for a while?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Artificial separation, I called it.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In truth, that was an ad hoc reason, something that came along conveniently as the day of my departure inched closer. Not that it wasn't true, though, it just wasn't what I intended to teach myself. Well, even before I landed on European soil, I learned the first lesson about myself, which is that I have zero capacity to forecast my own emotional response to something that I planned to do. I don't know why I never realized this before, but it's always the same. "Yeah I'll just do it, what's the worst that can happen?" Well, the worst at the time is a lot worse than the worst I could guess two months from flying out.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; No, what I had intended to learn was the legacy the Old Masters left behind, the secret behind their conquests that we, Western civilization, are still feeling the ripples of hundreds of years later. I wanted to learn what made these men - kings, emperors, artists of the millennium, men of God- immortal, not only in the literary sense but in the literal sense as well. I wanted to learn, and more importantly, I hoped that somewhere along the way, I would "find myself". This, perhaps, was a bigger cause for distress than the fear of getting lost. I desperately hoped that I would learn about myself, become different - different how, I wasn't sure. Just, different. That, in its essence, was the whole purpose of this trip, and I had, once again, not a single clue as to how to become different, or different enough to make it all worthwhile.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As I sat there, ironically awake, I began to wonder if I'll ever dream of the journey I was about to embark on...</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1407635063901_133663">&nbsp; &nbsp; Well.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I (obviously) did not fulfill my commitment of writing once a week during these 4 weeks of being on the road. Not even once.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I am, however, fully invested in completely and thoroughly chronicling my journey, if not as a very humble travel guide, then at least to verbalize my adventure to bring some kind of closure. But after the four weeks, where and how do I even start? How can I tell my stories in the ways that they deserve to be told? How do I make the distinction between the physical locations and the thoughts that were inspired by them? Is there even one?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Well, to avoid further delays, I'm just going to start with the easiest: the quantifiable.<br></p><hr /><h1 class="text-align-center">Trip Stats</h1><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Where Did I Go?</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I deviated from my planned course a bit, the most significant change being the extra time in Switzerland, at the expense of Milan and Venice. The changes were not so surprising given how little I actually planned, but what WAS surprising was how smooth the whole operation went as I did it on the fly. Here is a map of the route I took and the cities that I had the pleasure of visiting (left), and my actual schedule (right).</p><p><strong>Total Distance (As-the-Crow-Flies)</strong>: 4194km<br /><strong>Total Time (In Europe):</strong> 26 days and 18 hours</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Here are the cities typed out, in bracket is the name in the local language, if there is one:<br /><strong>Spain</strong>: Barcelona<br /><strong>Italy</strong>: Rome (Roma), Naples (Napoli), Pisa, Florence (Firenze), Venice (Venezia), &nbsp;Milan (Milano)<br /><strong>Switzerland</strong>: Interlaken, Basel<br /><strong>France</strong>: Paris<br /><strong>Netherlands</strong>: Amsterdam<br /><strong>Belgium</strong>: Brussels (Bruxelles)<br /><strong>UK</strong>: London, Lancing<br /><strong>Ireland</strong>: Dublin (Baile Átha Cliath ... yeah I don't know)</p><p><strong># of Countries</strong>: 8<br /><strong>#of Cities</strong>: 15<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; So aside from Ireland being Ireland, the English really fucked it up when they did the translation for Italian city names. I actually quite like the Italian versions. Actually, hearing Italians speak Italian is just great. Also, apologies to my Irish readers, but I finally understood the distinction between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Luggage</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the previous post (pre-trip), I put up a photo of all the things I packed...then I ended up taking out a few other things. Nothing major, just the second pair of pants, as well as the clothes that I wore on the day of flying out. The altered content is shown here (left), as well as my backpacks (right).&nbsp;Oh you must be wondering why all my shit are in ziploc bags. It took me a while to find these vacuum bags in the stores, but they were actually great for organizing everything, and squeezing the air out saved tons of space.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Almost everything I packed were put to good use, luckily. Some of the honorable mentions, aside from the essential clothing and equipment: <strong>Clif bars, bike light, selfie-stick, and earplugs.</strong>&nbsp;But, of course, some of the things never even breathed European air, which brings me to my:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>"Why-did-I-think-I-would-need-this" List</strong><br />1) Bluetooth keyboard: alright, I'm just going to put it out there that unless you're a professional writer, any hopes of writing on the road is a pipe dream. I don't mean that somehow writers can handle their craft better, but to put it simply, when you're on the road, if you don't have to do it, you won't. I ended up lugging around this thing and used it once, during my boat ride from Barcelona to Rome, and that was during the last two hours of the 20-hour journey simply because I couldn't sleep anymore.</p><p>2) Sleep-mask: I put them on, then I had an irrational fear of being raped, robbed, and/or having dicks drawn on my face. Bottom of the bag you go. People are very considerate to not turn the lights on at night.</p><p>3) Tide-To-Go: just don't. Don't even use this at home. I don't know what I was thinking, I must have forgotten that Tide-To-Go would really only be useful on white shirts, and that I only brought one white shirt, AND that Tide-To-Go actually makes white shirts yellow. Dropped some pizza on myself one day, I thought, "perfect, I'll use my Tide-To-Go." That slice of pizza is now forever commemorated by a bright yellow spot on my white shirt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other things I never used</strong>: swimming trunks (forgot to bring to the beach the one time I went), diarrhea meds (yay), Tylenol (yay again). In general, my advice for packing for a trip in Europe is this: they have everything that we have over here.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Money Matters</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Life-changing experiences don't come cheap, the total trip came to be a hair under $5000 (literally, a hair):</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When I first started planning the whole thing, I had budgeted for $4000. But soon after I purchased my plane tickets and the miscellaneous items, I'd realized that it would be closer to 5k. Daily spending was about $100 per day, which included food, lodging, tickets to get in museums, souvenirs, etc. Factoring in some odd train tickets and whatnot, things got rounded up nicely to a total of $5000.&nbsp;</p><p>Backpacks: $150<br />Eurail (Train) Pass: $440<br />Plane Tickets: $980<br />Credit Card Purchases: $1987.30<br />Debit &amp; Withdrawn Cash: $1331.90<br /><strong>Total: $4999.20</strong><br /> </p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I meant to write about this before I left. The following is the research I did before I left, which after seeing my transactions, I'm not sure is completely accurate. But basically there are 3 common ways of spending your money in Europe, which are:</p><p>1. Buying euros at home and taking the cash to Europe<br />- Bank uses its own exchange rate</p><p>2. Withdrawing euros from European ATM<br />- Uses foreign bank rate (whose ATM you're using)<br />- Your home bank charges you a flat fee for every international withdraw, which was $5 for TD. I believe some banks don't have this charge, like Chase.</p><p>3. Credit card<br />- Visa charges something like 2.5% for every transaction, and uses its own rate. Just an interesting side note, it took me 2 phone calls, a visit to TD, and going on Visa's website several times to find out this little fact, apparently nobody knows what the commission is.<br /><strong>UPDATE</strong>: apparently this is wrong. Turns out, TD (or your bank) tacks an additional rate onto Visa's own, as specified in your credit card user agreement, but the conversion rate is the one cited by Visa.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Just to clarify a point in case anyone is unfamiliar, banks use different rates for buying and selling. For example, if the actual CAD to Euro exchange rate is 1.5CAD for 1Euro, a Canadian bank might sell you euros at 1.55CAD for 1Euro, and buy your euro at 1Euro for 1.45CAD. For comparison, here is a sampling of the rates I got through the different methods, compared to the actual. Of course, these rates fluctuate everyday, but usually not by a huge amount.</p><table border="1" bordercolor="000000" style="background-color:FFFFFF" width="100%" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3">

</table><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Looking at this, it seems foreign ATM is the way to go. But in the end, it becomes quite inconsequential if you consider that the difference of 2% is about $10 for every $500 you spend. For some reason though, I got screwed by TD/Visa on the Pound, I don't know why that is, maybe TD's got a surplus of it back in Canada. Either way, I don't know why I spent so long detailing this. I'd recommend just doing what I did, withdraw some cash and use your credit card as much as possible. Finding the balance between having enough cash to be flexible, but not enough to break your bank if it gets stolen, is the key.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Eurail Pass</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; While I'm on the subject of money, I'll just talk a bit about the <strong>Eurail train pass</strong>. The pass I got was 5-days, 4 countries, meaning on 5 non-consecutive days, I can take as many trains as I want on those days, in the 4 chosen countries (I had Italy, Switzerland, France, Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg). I'm not sure why those last 3 count as one country, maybe it's under the same train operator. All that was for $440, or around 250 euros, which means for the thing to be worthwhile, I should take more than 50 euros worth of train on each of the 5 days.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So was it worth it? Well, firstly,&nbsp;train tickets are extremely cheap in Italy, and very rarely will you find a single second-class ticket for more than 60 euros, unless you're going across the country on one ride. I used a day for going from Naples to Pisa then to Florence, which was about 60 euros altogether. So if you're traveling in Italy, it'll definitely take some work to make it worth it, especially if you plan to stay in a city for a while. Trains in Switzerland and France are a lot more expensive, but here's the kick in the balls: almost all high-speed trains, i.e. direct, require reservation and a reservation fee, which the pass does not cover. This was the case in Italy too, going for about 10 euros. But in France and the Northern countries, they can go up to 40-50 euros,&nbsp;<strong>for just reservation. ALSO</strong>, France has limited number of seats available for reservation using the pass, so while a train might be empty, the passholder section might be fully booked out.&nbsp;For example, I took a Basel to Paris train, which consisted of a regional segment and a highspeed segment. The full price is 110 euros, but reservation was 40 euros alone. I was too cheap, so I opted to reserve a seat on the highspeed train to the stop before Paris and take the regional to Paris (which takes an hour longer), which only costed 10 euros, but they ended up letting me stay on all the way anyway, so that was nice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All in all, the rule of thumb is that if you'll be taking a lot of regional (slower) trains, then the pass is great since you don't need to reserve and you can just hop on the train, see the city, and go somewhere else. But if you're traveling in the Northern countries and taking direct trains, it might just be better to buy them as you go. In the end, I think I still saved some money, but I was committed to using the pass only when the ticket was going to be over 50 euros, which took some effort. I do, however, highly recommend the free Eurail/InterRail Rail Planner app. It's not 100% up to date and doesn't have all the regional trains, but the biggest advantage of it is that it can be used offline, so you can plan your trip on the fly even if you're not currently situated in a hostel.</p><p class="text-align-center"><strong>Other Fun Stats</strong></p><p># of days spent in Italy: 9<br /># of consecutive days I had pizza: 7<br /># of consecutive days I had pasta: 7</p><p>Lowest elevation achieved on foot: 2m (Amsterdam)<br />Highest: 2970m (Schiltorn, Switzerland)</p><p>Most unexpected thing I had to buy: superglue</p><p># of pictures and videos taken: 4745</p><p>Dollar drink menu at McDonalds in Italy serves: pop, water, beer<br />Big Mac Combo in Switzerland: 13 francs<br /><br /># of Madonna e Bambino (Virgin and the Child) paintings I saw: too many.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; That's all for now folks, I will probably be moving onto the actual content of the trip in the next post.

      <link>/blog/2014/7/8/rgaoeu2014-packing-list-pre-departures</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'll be on the plane heading for Barcelona tonight, and so begins my month long backpacking trip through Western Europe. My plan is to continue writing once a week, though I'm hoping that I'll get bit by the writing bug when I'm across the pond and at least jot down some thoughts about each city as I go.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For our first segment, however, I will go over one of the most important aspect of this trip today: packing and planning.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p class="text-align-center" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1404797800276_107223"><strong>Packing</strong></p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/53bf77c3e4b0974b49e13d9b/1405057050382/Packs.jpg" alt="Packs"/> Packs[/caption]


<p>Packing list (left). From top left:<br />[top row] rain jacket, 4 t-shirts + dress shirt, 4 pairs of undies + socks, towel, sleep sheet;<br />[middle row] misc. toiletries &amp; meds, belt, soft water bottle, more toiletries, bottled shampoo + soap + hand sanitizer, clif bars, shorts + long sleeve, pants + hoodie;<br />[bottom row] outlet adapter, &nbsp;tablet (bike light on top), keyboard, disposable camera, sunglasses, journal, eyemask, TideToGo, daily survival kit.&nbsp;</p><p>Packs (Right): daypack and 50L backpack, both from Mountain Equipment Coop</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see, nothing really spectacular is going into my bag here, except probably the tablet + keyboard because I want to write on the road (I might hate myself for this); the disposable camera is for reliving my journey at the end of it: some things are not meant for Instagram, at least not at the time. The daily survival pack has my contact lens case and solution, as well as phone charger, lotion, tooth brush, and earplugs. Not shown here: passport/money, phone, flipflops, running shoes, &amp; digital camera.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I packed pretty light, although I did manage to fill up my 50L bag in a hurry (10kg flat). Most things are stored in ziploc bags and rolled up if possible to improve organization and decrease volume taken up by air. The amount of time I spent looking for these little items like empty shampoo bottles, perfectly sized ziploc bags, etc, was way too much. In hindsight, most of these things can be found in Walmart and/or the dollar store. And if you're feeling fancy/lazy, you can always grab them at MEC. At the end of the trip, I'll make a list and see how many of these things were actually useful.</p><hr /><p class="text-align-center" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1404797800276_108209"><strong>Planning</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Here is my route and schedule, tentative. Everything is tentative really, that's why I'm doing this. I don't even know which touristy places exist where yet, so it will be a learning process.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; For now, just an overwhelming sense of fear and excitement. Also I'm writing this 5 minutes before the plane takes off, go figure.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Year 2</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/9/17/year-2</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's that time of the year again - my third year of graduate school will officially begin in a few days, and I thought this would be a great opportunity to reflect on the last year and pass this wisdom onto future me. But first, I decided to take a look at what I wrote down for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2015/9/15/year-1-part-ii">Year 1</a>, and boy was there ever some golden nuggets of wisdom that I completely ignored after writing them down. This blurb, though, summarizes very nicely what appears to be extremely clever foresight but, in hindsight, something I would've never kept in mind until it actually happened:</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>... having reflected on the year, is that when the two forces - passion and competitiveness - join hands, it’s very easy to spiral into a thoughtless routine and reach a burn-out stage with little warning. In other words, if we enforce the notion that what we are doing is what we are passionate in, mixed with the (Asian? North American?) culture of “always-be-doing”, then we tend to ignore our own bodies and the natural signals to relax and refocus. Eventually, some threshold is exceeded and fear overcomes passion, curiosity, and joy of exploring, at which point work becomes a burden and all I can do is youtube/imgur, possibly leading to existential crises and the conclusion that science is a pointless circle-jerk. Short of that, I had to squeeze every possible moment I had out of life and into work, which meant exercising less, both mind and body, and resort to things like Soylent (still love my goop though). <br/><br/>     More subtly, there is a problem of not prioritizing. Essentially, all work related things are deemed to be more important than personal things, based on some notion that “I have to”, and all those things are weighted equally so I need to DO ALL THE THINGS.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>

</figure><p>Sounds pretty ominous. Thinking back to first year, I don't recall going through a terribly bad phase of burn-out. Tired, for sure, but not intrinsically unmotivated, which leads me to wonder how I had been able to foresee the subsequent issues without changing my behavior to prevent it - and I had to think for a total of 10 seconds to realize why. But to properly tell the story, we have to pick up where we left off - the beginning of Year 2.</p><hr /><p><strong>The Ups</strong></p><p>The beginning of year 2 started after a nice west coast road trip with Mei, stopping along the way to see some natural Murican beauty and old friends. That was a great way to rest my brain for a bit and refocus before the start of the new academic year. I got right back into my projects, one of which was steadily picking up steam and getting positive results. On top of that, I had just gotten a short commentary published, proposing a computational (mathematical)&nbsp;model for a set of new empirical results, which counts for nothing in terms of academic currency but helped me feel like I could at least write "academic"&nbsp;enough to pretend to be one. All of these factors got me zooming through life once again, working and reading non-stop. As I write this now, I realized that, even as I had concerns about burning out and losing interest, there was no reason to change anything I was doing. Why would I? Everything was going great. I thought, or rather, I knew that as long as I keep up with reading everything I could find, and thinking about the problems 24/7, it would eventually all pay off and I'd be outta here (PhD)&nbsp;in no time. Plus, I felt like I had a good enough handle on my personal relationships, namely, making friends here and figuring out bit by bit how to tend to an ultra-long-distance relationship. Life was fast, but good.</p><p>Then in the fall, I attended my first Society for Neuroscience conference, which is THE neuroscience conference to be (sort of), where 20-some-thousand people gather for a week to nerd out about all aspects of the brain. It was 8 am to 6 pm days, followed by socials and what-have-you well into the night. It was probably the most intense 5 days of graduate school so far, trying to catch every poster and talk that interested me. But at the same time, it was an exhilarating experience because I felt like I was in the hub of discovery and everyone else was interested in the same things! I presented my own work there as well, and had a great time with the lab, further strengthening my feeling of being integrated into the scientific community - of feeling like I knew what I'm doing. The start of 2016 would prove to be even more extraordinarily lucky. With some willing collaborators and clever insights, we were able to find new pieces of evidence that really improved the state of my project. Even more fortunately, that project landed me a spot at one of the more specialized and competitive conferences, where I enjoyed some truly great talks and discussions with experts in computational neuroscience, as well as getting a chance to learn snowboarding in a great resort in Utah. After returning from that trip, the project was just about done and so we quickly hammered out a draft that was about 3 days from being submitted, and entertained the idea of several top journals because we all believed that the work was just that solid and impactful. And how I would stumble onto something that cool in my second year of PhD, who the hell knows?</p><p>There is a funny Chinese tradition that your "zodiac years" - when you are 12, 24, 36, etc - are the most unlucky years, where personal injuries or unfortunate disasters were more likely to happen to you, something about your zodiac animal offending the gods. Well, 8 months into being 24 and I felt lucky as ever.&nbsp;</p><p>Too lucky, in fact.</p><p>Amidst the daily push towards completing my first real research project and publishing a paper, there was always a nagging thought that plagued me - the better everything was, the louder that voice got. In hindsight, this would prove to be the biggest case of <strong>imposter syndrome</strong>: the conception of my successful project was, more than anything, a lucky insight that stemmed from lab bantering, and so the bigger it grew, the more worried I was that I would not be able to replicate,&nbsp;both the actual discovery itself and my apparent stroke of genius. What if I turned out to be a one-hit-wonder? Worse yet, what if I turn out to be a fraud of a scientist?? I started graduate school feeling like I was in a blind race against every other graduate student on the planet, simply because I didn't even know what I didn't know about neuroscience. At this point, however, I stopped racing against other people, which is good, and started racing against my own shadow that began to run ahead of me, which is not good.&nbsp;I can't tell you when, but at some point the work became less important than the perception of myself I was actively trying to maintain, or at least, putting more thought into.&nbsp;I am now, of course, both embarrassed and ashamed to admit that that had been the case, but in the moment, it was, like, a REALLY big deal for some reason, and I'm sure it's not an uncommon feeling for people. They named it a syndrome because enough people had it, obviously.</p><p>Well, as it turns out, I had one more lucky draw, and that prevented this whole fear from ever materializing.</p><p><strong>The Downs</strong></p><p>Long story short, somebody (thankfully) was able to find a pretty crucial mistake I made in my analysis. It wasn't a programming error, but a stupid decision in the analysis routine that I made quickly on the first pass that, to this day, haunts my conscience -&nbsp;because I can't say for certain whether I completely overlooked it, or if I rolled with it so happily and hastily because it produced results consistent with my hypothesis. In any case, that was about the only unexpected "bad" thing that had happened, which, objectively speaking, really shouldn't have had too big of an impact. It was simply a matter of re-running the analysis and seeing what the new results produced, but instead, it kickstarted a cascade of uncertainty in my work and myself.</p><p>To start, that particular analysis, when done correctly, did not support the hypothesis. The good news is that it did not contradict the ongoing hypothesis, thank the sweet lord, but it was inconclusive. That meant a splashy piece of evidence was suddenly yanked from what could've been a splashy paper, which now, in addition to it being a less splashy paper, meant no paper at all for at least a few more weeks as I reorganize. At the time, I tried my best to give it the "shit happens bro" attitude, and Mei had been here for that particular week so at least we got fried chicken together, but I think I only realized afterwards how big of a punch in the face that was. It was something I had worked very hard on, and had gotten <strong>that</strong>&nbsp;close to submitting a real research paper to a real journal, then all of a sudden, poof. I was disappointed and felt stupid, and it was the first confirmation that "yup, I just got way too lucky." On top of that, I felt like I had wasted everyone else's time for the last 2 months or so. From that point on, I made a choice to be more thorough and critical with my own work, which is, of course, good in principle and for the long term, but that just meant further delaying what was supposed to be a done deal while I left no stone unturned in a quest to at least prevent the preventable stupidity. Obviously there was never a guarantee that the paper would have been accepted or even reviewed, but I think I was sufficiently prepared for the peer-review process being a long pain in the ass that I would've been okay - at least I did all that I could do to get to that point. But to get so close and be turned away was, at the lack of a better phrase, a big fucking downer.</p><p>Like I said, one unfortunate thing happening shouldn't have been that devastating. But if my whole foundation of self-worth and values were based on work, then, of course, anything getting in the way of that meant I had nothing else to fall back on. As a side note, I finally understood why people were just so appalled with the idea of Soylent - it's a fundamental difference in value systems. I love eating and making great food for personal joy, but when I make it my mission to devote every living minute I possibly can to further my work, then it makes perfect sense that I'd want to make my meals as efficiently as possible, and I'm convinced that Soylent is TRULY the most efficient way of consuming life-sustaining nutrients, just not the most enjoyable. Other people, though, had different value systems, in which personal joy in the short term, and in tangible ways, was very important. Soylent appeared to be simply fuel for somebody who has become a robot, which was actually not too far from the reality. It was, in hindsight, a cry for help, or for somebody to take me out for lunch haha.&nbsp;The best part of that whole fiasco was that my Soylent binge had apparently inspired a friend in the lab to purchase such a big order that he couldn't finish drinking it before a big chunk of the remainder expired. Sorry Simon.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, back to the main point. What I've realized is that life is like marathons -&nbsp;not a single marathon, but multiple simultaneous ones. You're running one in getting to your career goals, but also one in maintaining good health, one for keeping up with hobbies, and one for fostering relationships with important people in your life. Sometimes we can dedicate all of our efforts to make a sprint in one particular race for a small amount of time, but in the long term,&nbsp;<strong>balance</strong>&nbsp;is crucial, lest you fall on your face in one race and look back to see how well you're doing in the other aspects of your life, only to have the other versions of you stare back from the starting line looking very confused. The worst part in all of this was that even when good things happened, they only served as further reminders that I had no clue what I was doing. For example, as a degree requirement to move onto the third year, we all had to give a talk summarizing the first 2 years of research progress to the entire department. Mine went really well and people seemed to have enjoyed it, but my first thought? Maybe I should just become a science journalist instead because sure,&nbsp;I can tell a science story, but CAN I ACTUALLY SCIENCE?!? I've been familiar enough with the concept of impostor syndrome ever since undergrad, but I never thought that I'd ever be afflicted by it. A big part of it, I think, is due to my hyper awareness of the harsh realities of academia, which brings me to ...</p><p><strong>Root Causes &amp; Takeaways</strong></p><p>So, after that long-winded story, what can I (and hopefully, you) take away from all of this? Having gone through this, I know that even if I had known what would've happened a year ago, I doubt I would've changed a damn thing, especially in terms of my life style and mindset. Such is being young. Although, there are things that would've given me comfort had I known about it beforehand.&nbsp;I'm not that much older now but I can certainly tell you that work is not everything there is to life, and there are much smarter ways of getting things done without spending ALL of your time on it. Laziness is the mother of all inventions, I think that firmly applies here - I only learned how to skim for crucial information in papers when I told myself there is no fucking way I'm spending an hour to read every single word of every paper. If there was one thing I regret, it's probably not dedicating enough time to my personal relationships, both in terms of nurturing old ones and growing new ones. It doesn't help that I lived on campus, which meant I literally can live in my work if I wanted to, but thankfully that's changing.&nbsp;So yeah, first thing is <strong>balance in all things that make me happy</strong>.&nbsp;I don't regret drinking Soylent though - NEVER!!!</p><p>The second thing gets at one of the root causes of my specific situation, which is the systematic issues in academia (or any high-pressure environment) leading to a lack of confidence in myself. In particular, the bleak picture that is presented as life in academia. Even though my immediate surroundings (lab, advisor, department) never gave me any pressure to produce in order to survive through graduate school and academia, one cannot help but be exposed to the harsh realities that everyone falls victim to, from graduate student to distinguished faculty alike: the mantra of publish or perish, the emphasis on "good" or "glam" journals,&nbsp;tiny percentages of PhDs getting research jobs, how long professors nowadays need to wait till their first major grant, the list goes on. Part of that message is genuinely good advice to give young scientists a realistic view of what life might be like in science, but the inadvertent effect is that some of us get swept up into the whirlwind of result-driven work, of doing whatever it takes to get to these checkpoints, without necessarily enjoying the process, all the while feeling dirty about how I've lost sight of the real goal of science. Funny enough, I came across a quote on Twitter of <a target="_blank" href="https://researchtopracticeconnections.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/losing-your-way-as-a-scientist-how-not-to-suck/">someone else's blog</a>&nbsp;speaking to this exact issue:</p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/57e854316a49634579c82c97/1474843710917//img.jpg" alt=""/>


<p>For a while, I was just so tired of working on the same damn thing every single day, to the point that I forgot what the point of any of that science is, other than to publish a paper so I can be on my way towards a PhD. "Intellectual cul-de-sac" is one way to put it, running through a pool of cornstarch is another way - why the fuck am I even doing this?</p><p>A good analogy, I think, is something I learned in the business world. For a while, I was on the start-up bandwagon, and one of the few consistent lessons that successful entrepreneurs tell is to aim to produce value, and not revenue. If a product tries its best to improve people's lives, then people will buy it, whereas focusing on revenue will only result in cutting corners for the sake of maximizing profit. I always thought this was a no-brainer, but I didn't realize how applicable it was in science. In hindsight, the only thing I should've focused on is to produce solid and reliable research, to the best of my abilities and knowledge, something that gets us incrementally closer to the truth, instead of setting goals like getting papers and grants. It would have been extremely difficult to not give into the pressures of career and academia, but would have brought peace amidst the chaotic process of discovery.&nbsp;I'm not saying I did BAD science, if that's what that sounds like, I'm just saying the pressure of "reality" can suck the fun out of a lot things. Looking back now, I think the key to wading through all that noise is <strong>integrity</strong>: a coherence between my actions and my values. This may partly diminish the effect of imposter's syndrome as well, as the expectations and image of myself will have more closely aligned with the day to day activities, of when I do good work and bad work.</p><p>The last thing is something I realized about science, which re-invigorated my excitement in continuing my PhD. For a while, I had thought that the point of doing research is to confirm hypotheses, finding evidence for the theories we have. But through the gift of failure, I realized that the truly important discoveries are the observations that defied all logic and expectation, spectacular failures that change the landscape of how people subsequently view the field. These, of course, are far and few, because most of the time we have a fairly good theory of how something works. This is especially true in a mature field like physics and chemistry - observations should be roughly consistent with the theories we have, because we've spent a LONG time developing those theories. Neuroscience, as well as cognitive and psychological sciences in general,&nbsp;are not like that, and especially after the recent fiasco in reproducibility and shoddy stats in fMRI, it's apparent that we don't have as good of theories (or experimental procedures)&nbsp;as other sciences, and there's nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;It's a complicated thing we're studying here, to say the least, especially when the ethics board is insistent that we don't implant electrodes in undergrad brains. What IS problematic is the bias for positive findings consistent with pre-existing theories, especially in cog/psych/neuro. All this is to say that, 999 out of 1000 times, a negative result may be due to mistakes or noise, but that one single time out of a thousand is the money-maker, and instead of wallowing in the disappointment of negative results, I should bask in the joy of new-found opportunity. So positive or negative, as long as we keep doing what we believe is right, there really is no bad outcomes, because <strong>science, more or less, is the business of looking for other people's (and your own) mistakes</strong>. This may already be obvious to experienced scientists who have had the rigorous training (or osmosis) in philosophy of science, but for a newbie like me, it really is a drastic shift in perspective. A happy side effect is that I feel like I'm much more critical of things I read now, because when I first started out, I thought if you publish something, that MUST mean it's true, and so I should just try to absorb everything I can. But after TWO YEARS, I finally, somehow, learned to critically evaluate new research, probably because a bunch of those findings contradict each other or make no sense.&nbsp;The challenge now is to be balanced, and not be OVER-critical or be an asshole about it.</p><hr /><p>Anyway, this is getting long so I'll try to wrap it up. I still distinctively remember thoughts from 6 months ago, something to the likes of "wow things are really going much better than I had anticipated right now, I hope it doesn't get there but I wonder how I will be able to deal with a major disaster." Well, shit happens and I'm still getting paid minimum wage to throw away my golden years trying to study something that's not even clear will ever be solved. So, life's still good. In all seriousness, I've had doubts about whether I'm cut out for science, as well as whether science is a worthwhile enterprise in trying to understand the brain and cognition, but through all that, the opportunities out there in discovering the unknown and maybe improving people's lives are just too enticing, so I'm still chugging along. As I write this today, and as bad as the story may have sounded, it was a pretty great year. I learned a TON of new things and became more comfortable with science, exercised pretty regularly, and did not lose any friends or family members. So I'm pretty grateful for how things have turned out, even the hiccups along the road.&nbsp;</p><p>As always, if you've had or are having similar struggles, whether in science school or whatever school or at an actual job (hah), I hope my experience helps you, either by avoiding the same roadblocks or providing comfort in knowing that things will be okay.</p><p>Well, until next year!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>LSD, Neuroscience, and Science Communication for the Armed and Dangerous</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/4/17/c9nbbvo0vij7z1t302zv4m0aenkrho</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: started out explaining a paper about LSD, visual hallucination, and fMRI; ended by ranting about science journalism. If you don't care about LSD, skip right to the end.</p><hr /><p>Earlier last week, a new <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/04/05/1518377113.full">scientific study</a> was published and received quite a lot of news coverage. The topic under investigation? Brains on LSD. Since it has brains, drugs, some foundational techniques in cognitive neuroscience,&nbsp;and apparently the neuroscience-equivalent of the Higgs Boson, I thought it'd be fun to do a quick dissection of the actual paper, and offer what will certainly be a much more nuanced (and hopefully more informed) perspective than some of the news coverage with overblown interpretations. But to start, I will leave you with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide">Wikipedia</a> blurb,</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), also known as acid, is a psychedelic drug known for its psychological effects, which include altered thinking processes, closed- and open-eye visuals, synesthesia, an altered sense of time, and spiritual experiences. It is used mainly as a recreational drug and for spiritual reasons.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>

</figure><p>and this article from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/11/lsd-impact-brain-revealed-groundbreaking-images">the Guardian</a>.</p><p><strong>What is brain?</strong><br />To sufficiently explain this study, we have to go over a few basic concepts about the brain first. In one sentence:&nbsp;our brains are composed of billions of brain cells (neurons), and they work via exchange of electrical and chemical signals delivered between neurons, which fulfills the roles of information transmission, computation, and storage. Of course, when I say that, it's a very physical (and vague) description of the underlying biology, and we have very little certainty about how information (like a memory) is actually represented. But for today, we can think of the brain as a whole lot of people talking via text messages, and packets of chemical signals called neurotransmitters, are the messages flowing from one person (neuron) to another. At this point, there are two important things to understand.</p><p>1. Serotonin<br />Neurons, like people, come in all kinds of different personalities. Each type of neuron can only <strong>send one type</strong> of message, dictated by which neurotransmitter it releases to other neurons, while they can <strong>receive many types</strong>&nbsp;of different messages, meaning that they will respond to different types of neurotransmitters. Serotonin is one such neurotransmitter, and neurons all over the brain have the ability to receive this chemical and respond to it in different ways. You may have heard phrases such as "serotonin is the neurotransmitter of happiness" or "dopamine means reward", but those are gross oversimplifications. As far as we know, there is a small cluster of serotonin neurons in the lower parts of the brain that, under normal conditions, send messages to other neurons ALL OVER the brain, to modulate their activity. The physiological effect of that on the receiving neurons is diverse and rather beyond my knowledge, and it actually goes beyond the brain to have direct and secondary effects on other parts of the body, such as the heart.</p><p>LSD, then, is a substitute for serotonin, as in when LSD is delivered to your brain, it acts just like serotonin, even though those serotonin neurons didn't send any messages. From the point of view of the receiving neurons, they couldn't care less. In fact, neurons EVERYWHERE throughout the brain are receiving text messages that look like this:</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>LETS PARTY<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; serotonin neurons</figcaption>
</figure><p>So you know what they're about to do - they're gonna get turnt up. And I was just informed via Wikipedia that LSD is unique in that it not only mimics serotonin, but dopamine as well, for a subset of receiving neurons. So for those neurons, the message is loud and clear:</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>PARTY WITH SEROTONIN NEURONS. TURN DOWN FOR WAT<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>
  <figcaption class="source">&mdash; dopamine neurons</figcaption>
</figure><p>(Actually, I just realized that an understanding of LSD is not at all required to understand this study, since it does not at all investigate the mechanism behind it. But still, these things are good to know.)</p><p>2. Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)<br />Neurons need basic resources to stay active, so when they are communicating a lot (via "action potentials"), they need more food and oxygen delivered to them. It turns out, blood delivers food and oxygen, and someone pretty smart figured out that if you measure blood flow to an area of the brain, you can make a guess of how hard neurons in that region are working. This is the basis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in neuroscience, and while there are several techniques that measure slightly different aspects of this signal, they are all related to changes in blood flow and blood oxygenation. The important thing to remember here is that CBF is an interpretation of neural activity, not an actual measurement. It's like if I were to measure how much food you eat per day to infer your activities: I can tell on days that you eat a lot that you were really hungry and probably did a lot of physical activity, but I won't be able to say exactly what you did. While this is a limitation for neuroscience research, it's largely an assumption that we are willing to make so we can infer SOMETHING about mental processes while measuring a physical signal.</p><p><strong>What actually happens when brain is on LSD?</strong><br />Now that we know all about how brains work and how to measure brain activity, let's get on to the paper. The experiment is simple. As with almost all cognitive neuroscience experiments, they want to measure people's brains while they have some kind of mental experience, and see if the two have any kind of relationship. Now the title of the paper almost makes perfect sense: <strong>Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging</strong>. I like straightforward titles.&nbsp;</p><p>So the setup is this:&nbsp;inject people with a small dose of LSD, then scan their brains while they do nothing (turns out they hallucinate). Have the same people come back, inject them with salt water, then scan their brains again while they do nothing (hopefully they don't hallucinate). Measure their brains and ask them a bunch of questions like "how much did you hallucinate" and "how much oneness did you experience with the universe", and see if there is a relationship between their brain activity and their mental experience. Well, onto the results then!</p><hr />

<p><br /><strong>Visual hallucination correlates with VISUAL cortex activation</strong><br />Figure 1 of the paper is shown above. The first row of brains is a snapshot of the blood flow to the participants' brains at 4 different depths (and a side view), and you can see that, when you are alive, blood flows to most parts of your brain (I thought we only used 10% of our brains???). The second row -&nbsp;when on acid -&nbsp;shows almost the exact same thing, and it's only when you subtract the 1st row from the 2nd, do you see an increase of blood flow to a small area in the back of the head, known as the visual cortex. This is the area of the brain that is activated when we see things, except, in this case, they're "seeing" mentally, because they're hallucinating. I'm not sure how this compares to when people try to visually IMAGINE, without doing drugs, but that would've been a better control condition. The scatterplot at the bottom shows that people's self-report of visual hallucination correlates with how much more their visual cortex is activated. In other words, the more you felt that you hallucinated, the more your brain was actually activated - pretty neat!</p><p>It's important to bring up a subtle point here: this experiment demonstrates the neural correlate of visual hallucination (i.e.LSD experience), not of LSD itself. Because people displayed a RANGE of altered behavior, since, as you can see, a few people reported almost no changes to their degree of visual hallucination (I'd love to know if it's because their "normal" visual experience is just the fucking bomb), it meant that LSD did not affect everyone in the same way. This will be true for the rest of the paper, in that their goal was to measure how brain activity alters in relation to the <strong>experiences</strong>&nbsp;LSD can trigger, but not how LSD works physiologically.&nbsp;</p><hr />

<p><strong>Visual hallucination correlates with increased "connectivity" of the visual cortex to other parts of the brain</strong><br />Forget about what I said at beginning, THIS figure is the reason why I'm writing this post. I don't have a particular problem with the actual figure in the paper per se (although plotting z-score is somewhat atrocious), but the way it was used in the Guardian article. In the article, the caption reads: &nbsp;"<strong><span style="font-size:12px">A second image shows different sections of the brain, either on placebo, or under the influence of LSD (lots of orange)</span></strong>". Now, if you didn't know any neuroscience at all and was shown this picture, what would be your first guess at what's going on here? Well, I can tell you what I thought after two years into graduate school: holy Batman, LSD makes your brain go crazy! The first time I heard about this study was, in fact, through the Guardian article, and I was shocked at how much effect LSD had in activating the entire brain. Alas, it was a good idea to read the actual paper:&nbsp;I was so perplexed because nowhere in there did it mention profound increase in brain activity. Well, it's because there wasn't. In fact, we just saw in the previous section that there was no increase in brain activity other than in a tiny region in the visual cortex. So what is this figure actually depicting then?</p><p>To understand that, I need to explain one more concept: <strong>resting state functional connectivity (RSFC)</strong>. Recall earlier we said that brain areas that are working harder requires more blood to be delivered, and this signal is recorded via fMRI and fluctuates rapidly, on the order of seconds. If two areas (A and B) show similar fluctuation of activity over time, then, we would assume that there is some special relationship between them. You might say that region A is sending messages to region B to activate it in a very similar way, causing the correlated activity. But without detailed knowledge of anatomical connectivity, this is a huge assumption. Instead, we simply call these two areas "functionally connected", and it's a measure of correlation between the blood flow signals of these areas. If we can correlated area A with area B, we can do it for A with C, A with D, etc. In this way, we hold area A as the "seed", use its signal as a reference, and correlate the signals of every other brain region with it to build a functional connectivity map, which is exactly what Figure 2 shows.&nbsp;</p><p>In the top row, our reference signal (seed) is taken from the visual cortex (purple blob), and the redness of the other areas indicate how correlated each of those areas are with it. I believe (I could be wrong) the actual color represents the z-score of the correlation, which is NOT the strength of the correlation, but how UNLIKELY that the observed correlation is due to chance. I don't do fMRI work, so I don't know what to criticize it too much without reading into it, and if someone can inform me of the actual reason, that would be great. But in general I don't know why the magnitude of the correlation is not plotted instead. ANYWAY, end rant. So in the middle row, we see that when hallucinating on LSD, many more areas of the brain (almost all of it) become "functionally connected" with the visual cortex, i.e. their fluctuating activities show increased correlation in time. The bottom row is once again the difference, and the scatterplot demonstrates that the more self-reported change in visual hallucination, the more change in functional connectivity (though it's debatable which is causing which).&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, how this figure was used made me very unhappy, but I will try to wrap up the paper quickly and come back to it at the end.</p><hr />

<p><strong>"Ego dissolution" correlates with decreased connectivity of parahippocampus</strong><br />The good thing about learning stuff is that it will maybe sometimes generalize. In this case, Figure 3 is in the exact same format as Figure 2, just with a different seed brain area and a different behavioral measure. Parahippocampus (purple blob again) is one of those areas in the brain where, if you were to ask someone what it does, they'll either say "hell if I know", OR they might say something stupid like "it recognizes scenery". I'm in the former camp, mainly because it's an understudied area, and it's (unfortunately) involved with more abstract processes like social behavior, which you can't really measure from a non-human mammal, or at least we don't have a great behavioral assay for it. A brief Wikipedia search will tell you that it's involved in schizophrenia and scene recognition, so take from it what you will. As far as I can tell,&nbsp;these authors basically picked it since there was prior evidence linking its activity to psychosis-like states under LSD.&nbsp;</p><p>"Ego dissolution", on the behavioral side, is also a fun one, I won't even attempt to find a definition for it, although I'm sure there was a somewhat tangible meaning in the surveys. Or, who knows, maybe it's the kind of shit that you just have to take LSD to know what it's like, and since the participants were all experienced drug users, they would be the ones to know. I guess if you want to find out what that's like, drop acid (or meditate deeply, I've read that induces similar states.) In any case, the result here is straightforward: decreased functional connectivity, particularly between the parahippocampus and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cingulate">posterior cingulate cortex </a>(PCC, large blue blob in the bottom row), correlates with the "magnitude" of ego-dissolution. The PCC has actually been studied a fair amount in the last 5 to 10 years, in the context of awareness and conscious experiences of the world.&nbsp;Interestingly enough, PCC is more activated during self-related thinking and decreased during meditation.</p><hr />

<p><strong>The "LSD experience" connects resting state networks</strong><br />For the previous two results, when the activity of one area of the brain is coupled with that of another, we said they were functionally connected, and you could then say that they were elements of a "network", since they are, effectively, in sync, albeit we do not know the direction of interaction between the two areas. Taking that a step further, we can look at all the areas of the brain simultaneously, and segregate brain regions into distinct networks based on the similarity of their activity. For example, if areas A, B, and F are co-activated, while C, D, and E are co-activated, we would call these two different networks with three elements (or nodes) each. This is exactly what <strong>resting state networks (RSN)</strong>&nbsp;are. Basically, when people lie in the MRI scanner and do nothing,&nbsp;somehow, about 10 or so brain networks consistently show up, each with roughly the same functionally connected areas between different people. Thus, they were dubbed RESTING STATE networks. Nobody really knows for sure what they do or why they are there, but there are some ideas such as a network that keeps visual vigilance even when you're not looking at anything in particular, such that when threats do appear, you have time to react. Others, such as the default mode network, are related to self-referential thinking that inevitably happens when you are told to lie in a tiny tube and do nothing. My favorite aliases for these are, for example, the "thinking about my lunch" network and "did I lock my door" network.&nbsp;</p><p>In this last figure, then, we see the activity of these 12 resting state networks (purple blobs) change during the experience of LSD. Firstly, only the 3 visual RSNs saw slight increase in blood flow (CBF, red bars) under LSD compared to control, once again showing that LSD does not actually increase neural activity. On the other hand, all 12 networks saw consistent decrease in network <strong>integrity</strong>, meaning the activity of members (brain areas) within each network became less similar under LSD (blue bars). Finally, the activity of different RSNs became more like each other, i.e. decreased <strong>segregation</strong>, as shown in the last checkerboard plot where each tile is the increase in activity similarity between the network in that row and column (diagonals blank since the same network is always exactly similar to itself).&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, the conclusion is that while tripping on acid,&nbsp;the visual networks are more activated and "more connected" to other brain regions, particularly in the context of visual hallucination,&nbsp;while these resting state networks often associated with thinking about self and rumination are "more dissolved." I think that this is a great study ("Higgs Boson of neuroscience" might have been overstating it) and a good first step towards legitimizing drug-related brain research, one avenue that we are really not taking advantage of. Given that these people are experienced users, we're not introducing additional risks by having them do drugs while getting their brain scanned, and it can reveal a lot of interesting things that brains under normal conditions simply cannot.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p><strong>Science Communication and Journalism</strong><br />With the study out of the way, I want to take this opportunity to comment on pop science. I've been wanting to write something about it for a year and half now, but never found the "right" thing to dig into, but since I already went through the science behind this particular study, I might as well take the opportunity to look at how news articles deliver. As always, there is a diversity of nonsense, depending on which news outlet you're looking at. One example, headline from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/13/what-your-brain-actually-looks-like-on-drugs/">The Washington Post</a>:&nbsp;"<strong>Groundbreaking images show how LSD literally lights up your brain.</strong>"&nbsp;While the article itself has some redeemable qualities and insights, this title is the kind of thing that makes me want to strangle a journalist. First of all, what the fuck does it mean to literally light up the brain? It certainly does not refer to the dramatic increase in neural activity under LSD, because there was none. My only interpretation for this is that this particular author saw Figure 2 in the paper and literally transcribed his LITERAL interpretation of those figures. The problem, I believe, arises from a lack of background context and formal training. I'm not trying to be a snobby educated person or anything, but those images will show different things to a layman vs. someone who has even the least bit of knowledge about brain imaging, such that the latter would never think to describe it as "lit up". And I don't mean to rip into this one person in particular, it happens time and time again, and every time I see something like this I just experience a cycle of anger, disgust, reluctant acceptance, and fear that someone will "learn" something from this article. &nbsp;Again, I don't necessarily believe that it's one person refusing to do their job properly, but that they lack the proper training to interpret neuroscience studies.</p><p>This problem is better highlighted in an article that's not such a blatant offender. The Guardian article, for example, was great. It did not stretch the interpretation of the study, and generally described the results in line with how the authors did in the paper itself. But after a close reading, it is apparent that it is only that: an accurate recount of the findings in the study that skip details whenever possible, and with little actual understand of the topic at hand. For example, "functional connectivity" means a very different thing to a fMRI scientist, because it does not imply actual connectivity, as I outlined above. But for a lay person exposed with the basics of the brain, connectivity in the context of neuroscience probably means physical connections, i.e. synapses. In other words, I wouldn't put it past someone to interpret this finding as "LSD increases brain connections." Also, posting the figure without a detailed explanation of what the colors and blobs mean is a dangerous thing to do, because then it allows any one person's literal interpretation of the image with the apparent validity of "science", such that you get shit like "LSD lights up the brain". This is not a hypothetical situation, I know because I also came to my own interpretation of the image after reading the news article (maybe I'm just not critical?), which was promptly corrected after reading the actual paper.</p><p>So why is this a problem? Well, on a smaller scale, it's not. Worst case scenario is that some people are slightly misinformed about the effect of LSD, and you might say that the people who will get it wrong don't matter because it's just a light bathroom reading for them, and the people who will get it right will get it right anyway because they don't base their perception on secondary reporting in news articles (though let's be honest, who's going to read the actual paper?)&nbsp;This assumes a two-tier population in terms of scientific understanding, which leads us to think about who these news report of science are targeting -&nbsp;and I think this gets at the actual problem. The reality is, there is a spectrum of lay people in terms of their engagement with science, and depending on what field you work in, even scientists get relocated on this spectrum. By that I mean, for example, I will read neuroscience papers for their findings and implications but I get most of my understanding of new breakthroughs in physics through the news app on my phone, and not the primary sources themselves, because I don't have the understanding required to evaluate the study in its raw form.</p><p>I think to accurately describe this situation, we need a model with three groups of people. The first group is the "scientists", people that care tremendously about the details of a particular reporting and will make informed choices based on what they read. Most people that fall within this group are probably actual scientists and graduate students, but lay people who are particularly interested in a line of research for whatever reason also fall in here. The second group is what I would call one-and-doners: people who read these things purely as a past-time and does not take any of this into their actual lives. Classic example: your grandma. These first two groups are not interesting, because they are the people who will get it right anyway and the people for whom it really doesn't matter.</p><p>The third group is what I would call "armed and dangerous", and given the dramatic increase in our ability to access information via the internet, this is a growing group of concern. Basically, "armed and dangerous" means that you are educated enough to understand the information, perhaps because you have an education in sciences or a related field, and you WILL make life decisions based on it. Not only do these people have the power to change their own lives, they have the power to influence people around them and even society as a whole via voting and lobbying and protesting. For these people, they will trust the news articles for what they are, perhaps because they don't have the ability or desire to read the actual papers (like me with physics). In this case, it's absolutely crucial to convey the information in the most accurate way possible, and "increased connectivity" vs. "increased functional connectivity" vs. "the brain lit up" all have very different outcomes for these people. In the context of LSD, it probably doesn't really matter, because it's quite a niche thing in people's daily lives. But if we look at other health-related research that can potentially alter someone's lifestyle and behavior,&nbsp;such as marijuana research, nutrition research, and, oh god, vaccine research, conveying information accurately becomes very, very important. It's the same thing as politics, for democracy to work, your voting base should be as informed as possible. While this is proving to be more and more untrue as this clusterfuck unfolds in the U.S., I would say it's even more important for the voting base to be informed accurately regarding science.</p><p>This, then, becomes an engineering problem for science journalism: how do you write for the lay-but-educated population, for whom actionable outcomes are a very real possibility, while still keeping the content engaging so information is disseminated and the company gets paid? Well, for one, maybe it helps to have semi-experts that can outline the important assumptions and interpretations of a particular study. Grad students and neuroscientists all know, for example, that any fMRI research comes with the invisible disclaimer in the first line that says "we don't actually know what we're measuring but it should be fairly representative of actual brain activity". But regular people that have other things to do in their lives don't know that. And if, somehow, in a weird parallel universe, a particular health policy hinges on whether LSD makes actual brain connections or "functional connections", then it'd be damn important for people to know what that actually means.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Keeping the wolf from the door</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/1/6/keeping-the-wolf-from-the-door</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>an excerpt from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/magazine/karl-ove-knausgaard-on-the-terrible-beauty-of-brain-surgery.html?_r=1">The Terrible Beauty of Brain Surgery</a>:</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>I sat down in one of the few empty chairs outside and looked at people, speculating about the relationships they had to one another and to the world.<br/><br/>I had always considered my thoughts as something abstract, but they weren’t; they were as material as the heart beating in my chest. The same was true of the mind, the soul, the personality; all of it was fixed in the cells and originated as a result of the various ways in which these cells reacted with one another. All of our systems, too — communism, capitalism, religion, science — they also originated in electrochemical currents flowing through this three-pound lump of flesh encased in the skull.<br/><br/>All of which was saying nothing. It was like examining a stone in the foundation wall to find the answer to the secret of St. Peter’s Basilica.<br/><br/>That was all just a lie, Petrela had said about Albanian Communism.<br/><br/>But what wasn’t?<br/><br/>I had asked Marsh if he believed in God, in a life beyond death. He just shook his head. “This is it,” he said.<br/><br/>We use systems to keep the wolf from the door, I thought. And systems are nothing but vast complexes of notions and concepts. Everything that helps us lose sight of the petty, pathetic and meaningless parts of our own selves. That is the wolf. The awkward, twisted or stupid part of the soul, the grudges and the envy, the hopelessness and the darkness, the childish joy and the unmanageable desire. The wolf is the part of human nature that the systems have no room for, the aspect of reality that our ideas, the firmament that the brain vaults above our lives, cannot fathom. The wolf is the truth.<br/><br/>So why would Marsh want to keep the wolf from the door? Seen from the outside, it seemed that the role of surgeon had provided him with a larger context in which he could excel and rule over life and death, where there was no place for whatever was small and insecure in him. The role of surgeon gave meaning to his life, lifted the meaning outside of himself, into a system — it kept the wolf from the door. At the same time, that role revealed the meaninglessness of it all. Tumors grew randomly, people died randomly, every day, everywhere. You could choose to keep this from sight behind numbers, behind statistics, behind the plastic drapes that made the patients faceless. His greatness was that he didn’t hide the smallness but instead used his insight into it to fight against everything that concealed it, the institutionalization of hospitals, the dehumanization of patients, all the rituals established by the medical profession to create distance and to turn the body into something abstract, general, a part of a system.<span>&#148;</span>

      <title>Neuroscience: Watching the World Series in a Room Behind Tall People</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/10/31/neuroscience-watching-the-world-series-in-a-room-behind-tall-people</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've always wanted to write about some of the fundamental ideas in neuroscience in a people-friendly way. The problem is, it always seemed to be way too daunting to explain such fundamental ideas in any reasonably short blog entry, given all the history behind the idea and the recent debates over it. Well, nothing screams challenge than to do exactly that for a bunch of high school students, with a hard limit of ONE PAGE. Yes,&nbsp;I am, once again, shamelessly pasting homework assignments onto the blog, but this one I'm rather happy with. Plus, it's in the spirit of the World Series, even though I literally watched my first full inning of baseball when the Jays lost in game 6.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a summary of a paper published a few years ago, which I thought was excellent science. Plus, it's a step forward for one of the fundamental ideas in neuroscience: information coding. I originally wanted to expand the version I had for the high schoolers, add some details here and there, and post it as a modified version. But god knows 1) I'm lazy and 2) I'll probably add 2 pages worth of stuff to this 1 page summary. Alas, here it is. Do let me know if it speaks to your inner high school self. I don't know if the paper is open access now, but it's linked at the bottom.</p><hr /><p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

The problem is, so many people are standing in front of you that you can’t see anymore, but you still want to know what’s happening: what can you do? We all know that people lose all ability to speak coherently in the heat of the game, so you can’t ask someone to describe the events, but you CAN observe how intensely people are cheering around you, and the reaction of the room in general: quiet crowd, no runs; room explodes, someone probably scored. Your problem, as a scientist, is to guess the events on TV based solely on people’s responses, but you can only pay attention to so much. Then, is it more informative to listen for your friends immediately around you, since you know when and how they usually respond? Or is it better to listen to the room as a whole? This is exactly the question these neuroscientists are trying to answer – only, for the brain.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">One of the fundamental assumptions we make in neuroscience is that events that occur in the world around us are reflected in brain activity. For example, to ‘hear’ your favorite song, your brain must process the sounds and identify it. How the brain does this is not 100% clear yet, but what we do know is that neurons – the fundamental information processing cells in the brain – respond to stimuli by changing when and how fast they ‘fire’ action potentials. Imagine if each of the 80 billion neurons in your brain is a tiny person, and the only way they can respond (as far as we know) is by shouting ‘YAY!’ When it sees something it likes, it gets excited and shouts ‘YAY YAY YAY’; otherwise, it stays silent. For a long time now, we’ve known that individual neurons respond to their preferred stimulus (sound, image, etc.) by changing the rate of their response, analogous to how fast it’s shouting (firing rate). Then, if we were to record the activity of a neuron - let’s call it Ned - as it responds to a sound, we’d be able to see how much of the sound corresponds to Ned’s activity, via “mutual information”. Essentially, mutual information </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">quantifies how successfully we could guess the sound by observing Ned’s response. In our baseball example, Ned (from New York) cheering shares high mutual information with the Mets scoring a run. Similarly, the aggregate response of many neurons (like our crowd), called local field potential, could also be informative, even though we lose the individuals’ identities. These are all ways your brain can “code” information, so which is the most informative?</span></p><p><span style="font-size:11.0pt">In this paper, the authors answer this question by playing sounds to a monkey, and measuring the mutual information between various sounds and the monkey’s brain response – both from individual neurons and the local field potential. Historically, neuroscientists have been fixated on the firing rate of individual neurons, but this study shows that other “codes” could be much more informative and reliable, especially in combination, such as the timing relationship between several different neurons’ response, as well as the relative timing of action potentials with respective to the local field. Intuitively, hearing Ned cheer could mean one of many things – the Mets pitching a strike, getting on base, or scoring a run. But hearing the room cheering and immediately groaning followed by Ned shouting excitedly probably means that the Royals almost hit it out the park, only to be caught by the Mets outfield leaping off the fence to make the catch. This is a really exciting result because it shows that the brain works as a whole, such that combinations of responses give us the most information about what we observe around us, and it opens up new ways for neuroscientists to accurately decode information in the brain, taking us a step closer to understanding how it all works.</span></p><p><span style="font-size:15px">Source: Kayser et al. 2009.

      <title>Year 1 (Part II)</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/9/15/year-1-part-ii</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is now technically 10 minutes into the first day of second year, which means that, surprisingly, I finished this on time.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Blind Marathon</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I first arrived in San Diego for interview in February of 2014, 8 months before I moved here for good, I asked myself: "how the hell does anyone get any work done over here?" This is a reflection of two things. First, San Diego is beautiful, even more so is La Jolla, where UCSD is located -&nbsp;a suburban ocean-side paradise just north of San Diego proper. I love the ocean, the horizon, the palette of colors that seemed to cover the entire visible spectrum during those special sunsets...those sunsets that you get to see 6 days out of 7. And the beaches, my god, I've never been to a beach where there was more sand than people until I came to La Jolla. Better yet, it's true what they say: UCSD is a 15 minute walk to the closest beach. Um what? Excuse me while I go jump in the emerald water and ride the waves, bro (is this what we say here?)&nbsp;The second thing, though, was not immediately obvious to me at the time, but in hindsight made so much sense. The very question itself was a reflection of my own fear:&nbsp;I was afraid that I would get lost in this little sandy paradise, and that I wouldn't be able to get any work done. After all, committing to a PhD for 5+ years is not a light decision, seeing that I've got family, friends, and a girlfriend that I could go back home to, so I was very much aware of my timeline, before even taking into considerations of the fact that I pretty much get kicked out after 5 years. I wasn't in a rush to leave, per se,&nbsp;and I knew that science, like all other creative endeavors, required time:&nbsp;time for failures, to learn, and to catch up on all the things that I was never exposed to in my engineering undergrad. But when faced with the two imperatives, I did the obvious thing that any sensible person would do: work 12 hours a day instead of 8, so I can do more with less.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> </p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This wasn't much of a problem at first. In fact, it was exhilarating. I was always reading papers, because there were so much neuroscience to cover and I started with so little. And when I started to get going on projects about midway through the year, it's analysis after analysis after analysis. If you were to learn anything about graduate school, it's that there is always more to do (or maybe I'm just a procrastinator). I have a to-do list filled with papers I want to read and ideas I want to test out, it's literally never ending.&nbsp;It is a scary thing when you combine a thirst for knowing more with a fear of not doing enough -&nbsp;perhaps two of the most powerful drives a person can have. Eventually, you become consumed by the problems, and every waking moment is a possible inspiration to think harder or tinker some more. This is not to say that I've accomplished or produced much, but one aspect I do feel good about is the vast collection of neuroscience literature I've read in the past 12 months, simply because I didn't know what a hippocampus was just 12 months ago.&nbsp;By way of analogy, my first year was like being dropped in the middle of a marathon, blindfolded. I don't know where I was in the pack, and I don't know how hard I had to run to get ahead, all I knew was that I just had to keep running in fear of a scary monster that was going to catch up and eat me.</p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, none of the above is a complaint about the hardship of graduate school, because it was neither asked of me nor required. In fact, my year-end review came back with the comment: "you need to take a vacation man." It's also not to say that I spent every living moment working, or that I was at all a model graduate student, because I definite spent time doing stupid shit,&nbsp;took time off to hang out with new-found friends and colleagues, and kept playing basketball (barely), though I didn't spend nearly as much time as I had hoped on the beach, and I consider it a personal failure that I hadn't tried surfing even once. What I do mean to say, having reflected on the year, is that when the two forces -&nbsp;passion and competitiveness - join hands, it's very easy to spiral into a thoughtless routine and reach a burn-out stage with little warning. In other words, if we enforce the notion that what we are doing is what we are passionate in, mixed with the (Asian? North American?) culture of "always-be-doing", then we tend to ignore our own bodies and the natural signals to relax and refocus. Eventually, some threshold is exceeded and fear overcomes passion, curiosity, and joy of exploring, at which point work becomes a burden and all I can do is youtube/imgur, possibly leading to existential crises and the conclusion that science is a pointless circle-jerk. Short of that, I had to squeeze every possible moment I had out of life and into work, which meant exercising less, both mind and body, and resort to things like Soylent (still love my goop though).&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More subtly, there is a problem of not prioritizing. Essentially, all work related things are deemed to be more important than personal things, based on some notion that "I have to", and all those things are weighted equally so I need to DO ALL THE THINGS. Actually, this doesn't only apply to work, because sometimes I will make a note to write something for the blog because I really want to and haven't taken the time to in a while, but as soon as I write it down on the list of "things I have to do", it will inevitably not get done, at least without some dragging and screaming. I'm not saying to-do lists are evil, I'm saying, I personally have trouble listening to what my brain and body actually want to do, and instead, I impose what needs to be done based on some utility criterion, which is not the same thing as happiness, and that literally sucks the fun out of everything. Well, in the upcoming year, I definitely vow to pay more attention to my own flow (at a lack of a better word), partly because I've convinced myself that I'm not an idiot and I could definitely do this, but more so because, fundamentally, I believe passion and curiosity are much more powerful drives than fear and competition, and that if I listen to my own intuitions, things will naturally work out. Because, in reality, whether there is a monster chasing me or not, I probably can't run any faster either way, so why put the mental burden of always going faster on myself?</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Luck &amp; Social Support</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two things that don't get brought up quite enough in our "meritocratic" world, especially in a profession like science, are luck, and people around you.&nbsp;Lucky breaks, or opportunities, if you prefer,&nbsp;are undoubtedly helpful, but they can manifest in many different ways, and usually much later on down the road. One example:&nbsp;on the very first day of meeting Brad (aka Not A Polish Bear aka my advisor), I inherited a half-baked collaboration out of nowhere with a local stem cell lab, which had very little to do with what I thought I would work on in grad school. Actually, at the time, the project seemed fully baked - the data was being collected, the goals were clear, and the story for the sell was better than most (well...I was sold). Exactly one year later, the project made no demonstrable progress, at least not on my end of the work (ha..ha...yup), mainly because the difficulty of an experimental science is unpredictable and independent of, if not anti-correlated with, how badly you want it to work. Though despite all that, we were able to write a successful grant proposal which helped pay for my summer salary, among other things.&nbsp;More importantly,&nbsp;I've made a good friend in the collaborating lab who's now teaching me how to take human stem cells,&nbsp;derived from skin tissue, and grow them into neurons (WHAT?), as well as general wetlab know-hows, which literally took what I thought was possible for my PhD and sent it into warp-fucking-speed to the other end of the galaxy, no exaggerations.</p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Which brings me to the second thing: the right people play a huge role in a graduate student's success and happiness. I don't know about you, but whenever there's a news article that starts with "scientists discovered...", I automatically think of a bunch of boring old physicists in lab coats huddled around some beakers or a particle accelerator. In reality,&nbsp;"scientists discovered..." most probably means a bunch of guys and gals sitting around debating endlessly about the most minute (and possibly mundane)&nbsp;of details, over a drink or 3, until someone had a bright idea that challenged the current understanding of things - at least that's the way it is in a young field like neuroscience. I say this because the majority of my ideas that was worth any salt came out of extended discussion with very bright people in my lab (almost always after or outside of formal lab meetings), or with sympathetic friends and classmates in my life, and I've heard many more stories through the year to corroborate this point. In fact, my understanding now is that the "smart" part of science comes from after-hours conversations and diligent reading, and the experiments and lab work are just balancing the books to check for errors, though serendipitous discoveries do happen once in a while. Aside from actual science,&nbsp;there are definitely dark moments during graduate school, be it from an unreasonable problem set, administrative bullshit, or just a plain bad day. These are first-world problems, sure, but no problem is a small problem when you're in it, and having understanding friends, family, and significant others help tremendously in getting over the hump. These small things are the exact things you never think about as a naive young person out here trying to rock the world, but will surely come to appreciate, especially after being thrown into a brand new place under constant tension. So, call your parents, your buddies, and your S.O., and tell them they are directly contributing to the advancement of our species through science.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>What Do I Actually Do?</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I alluded to in Part I, if you tell someone that graduate school isn't really school and you mainly work on a research problem, you run the risk of them asking, "well, what do you do?" This is probably the bane of any graduate students' existence (other than "when do you graduate"). Why? Because half of us literally have no fucking clue, and the other half simply cannot explain it in 15 words, as you expect them to between consecutive sips of your beer over mildly obnoxious music. Not that I don't want to explain - it truly is a struggle between saying something so simple and watered-down that you'd feel like I was patronizing you or being unreasonably curt ("I'm working on a cure for autism"), and saying something full-blown that truthfully represents the problem but risking you consuming your entire beverage and falling asleep, or worse, think that I was a pompous asshole ("What kind of autism? Oh well you see it's really just a disease model, and I'm obviously not allowed to work on or even touch any real patients, so what I actually do is create in-vitro - that means in a lab environment - models of the disease that we think represents the real one so I can - hello? Hello?"). None of this, of course, is your fault as the lay listener. In fact, I very much like the idea of a science elevator pitch, or a one-liner, though graduate students do have very limited opportunities to practice this aspect of their lives, because if you are a graduate student, 90% of your daily interactions are probably with other graduate students, who are probably also involved in similar problems. Nevertheless, I am working on it. Maybe next time I'll tell the bus driver what I'm working on. On second thought, maybe I'll start with my parents and girlfriend.</p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So what do I actually do? The stem cell collaboration project is rather simple in concept, at least the motivation behind it: patients with genetic brain disorders often present compromised mental capacity in one way or another, and we want to study their brains to formalize the biological problem in order to understand it and ultimately come up with treatments for it. The obvious problem is that you can't just cut out people's brains, so instead, somebody came up with a truly ingenious work-around, which is to transform a rather disposable part of their body (sorry, that means you, skin) into stem cells, which can then be turned into whatever. In our case, brain cells, specifically such that the genetic defect is present, so in theory, the brain cells present exactly the same problems as the ones in a person's brain. In that way, we can grow these brain cells into tiny surrogates of the patient's brain, and compare with a network of wild-type (regularly functioning) brain cells to see what irregular behaviours arise out of diseased cells. You can imagine, for example, trying to detect a certain type of protein that is crucial for brain functions, to see if there's less or more of it in the diseased cells. Instead of a protein, we are looking for abnormal activity in their electrical signatures. I can't really elaborate more because I actually don't know, at the moment, what is the exact signature that goes wrong, but we have ideas.</p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My main project currently is somewhat related. Like I just said, we usually don't cut into people's brains, so we can only afford to record electricity from the scalp to study the brain, and even when we do cut, under very special circumstances like a required neurosurgery, we usually only cut open the skull, which allows us to place electrodes on top of the brain surface, but not into the brain itself. When I say us, by the way, I mean not us, and very capable neurosurgeons (but not bigoted Republican nominees).&nbsp;Observing the brain electrically is like trying to hear someone in a really crowded room. As it stands right now, the gold standard is to be able to hear exactly what a few individuals are saying (single neurons). To do that, though, one has to shove pointy electrodes INTO the brain, not just on top of, which is a hard thing to convince undergraduate participants to be a part of. Well, undergrads all have their price, but it's probably harder to convince the ethics board to let you do that. Anyway, short of doing that, we are left with surface recordings of the brain, which is like listening to the general murmuring of the room and hearing nothing in particular. However, that is not to say that the general murmuring does not contain information. In the past, people in the field have mainly been interested in, roughly speaking, how loudly a certain quadrant of the room is overall, which, outside of this analogy, has implications (correlations) with some aspect of behavior, but we're really not able to parse out too much of what's being said. My work, and the interest of the lab, is to be able to derive more information out of the murmuring. For example, even if you couldn't identify who said what exactly, being able to parse out common topics of conversation when several people talk about things like "cheese" or "Donald Trump" is still incredibly useful and allows you to make certain predictions because, well, you can make more sense of these people. If anything, it will let you know which part of the room to migrate towards to get away from potentially stupid conversations. In such a way, we are by-passing experimental limitations and (theoretically) making use of a signal that's largely been thought of to have limited use. It's a very interesting problem from a scientific/mathematical perspective, but also could have very practical applications in, I hate to use this term but, "brain-reading" technologies, without being extremely intrusive (I mean medically, because nothing is more intrusive than brain-reading, really).&nbsp;For a teaser, see <a target="_blank" href="http://voyteklab.com/interpreting-the-electrophysiological-power-spectrum/">this</a>.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Concluding Remarks</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I hope this has provided a glimpse of what it's like to be a graduate student in the Department of Cognitive Science, working on Computational Neuroscience, but also dabbling in Tissue Engineering. Like I said, I realized that my experience after a year in grad school was, more than anything, a factor of my own personality, which made it unnecessarily stressful at times. It has also been fairly limited, as I ramp up to doing more research than courses.&nbsp;Maybe it's confirmation bias, or trying to resolve my internal cognitive dissonance, but I am really fortunate in that I have a lot of fun with what I do, largely due to where I'm doing it and who's helping me to do it, and who I can turn to when I'm momentarily tired of doing it. Being across the continent from where I call home isn't the greatest (I think I'm starting to sound like I'd rather live in my parents' basement for the rest of my life), but for now, I will make the best of my time away from those ungodly winters (but also live with THE worst public transportation), and enjoy these few years of absolute intellectual and personal freedom.</p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As always, comments and questions are more than welcome, especially if you're a graduate student scouring from one event to another struggling to feed yourself - JOIN THE SOYLENT WAY, MAN.&nbsp;<br /> </p><p style="text-align:justify"> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>So long, robo-rat overlord. I hardly knew ye.</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/7/22/so-long-robo-rat-overlord-i-hardly-knew-ye</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So about a week ago I read&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11869">this</a>&nbsp;[1] article from Nature, about what I thought at the time was to become our rat-robotic overlords. If you haven't read the article, here's an excerpt from the abstract:</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>...Brainets, i.e. networks formed by multiple animal brains, cooperating and exchanging information in real time through direct brain-to-brain interfaces ... built by interconnecting four adult rat brains ... worked by concurrently recording the extracellular electrical activity generated by populations of cortical neurons distributed across multiple rats chronically implanted with multi-electrode arrays. Cortical neuronal activity was recorded and analyzed in real time, and then delivered to the somatosensory cortices of other animals that participated in the Brainet using intracortical microstimulation (ICMS)...<br/><br/>...different Brainet architectures solved a number of useful computational problems, such as discrete classification, image processing, storage and retrieval of tactile information, and even weather forecasting.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>

</figure><p>In case you weren't following, let me rewrite the last part again, in bold: <strong>"</strong><strong>...different Brainet architectures solved a number of useful computational problems, such as discrete classification, image processing, storage and retrieval of tactile information, and even weather forecasting."</strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Uh. Holy shit? This sounds truly incredible. Why? Because we humans can't even predict the goddamn weather.<br /><br />Is it actually as incredible as it sounds? Well, is anything ever? But, in my rush of joy for the neuroscientific community at large, and to make what I do (though not at all related) sound fucking awesome, I was trigger-happy and shared it on Facebook, after reading only half the paper. In my defense, it was Friday evening and I was not about to miss some free beer. But the feeling of being roped crept into my consciousness ever so slowly - I should have known: if there was ever an award for "Most Clickbait Abstract", this paper would win, hands down. Well, I finished reading it, and I will now repent my sins by telling you exactly what this Brainet was and was not able to do.</p><p>If you're looking for a TL;DR, here it is: it's not as crazy as it sounds, not even close, it certainly isn't forecasting weather in any meaningful way. That being said, it was still kinda cool...kinda. Skip to the section that says "What it's not" if you really don't want to read further.</p><p><strong>Setup</strong><br />I'll start with the setup. Here's Figure 1 from the paper describing the Brainet:</p>

<p>Each rat receives electrical input to S1, which is shorthand for somatosensory cortex, which is shorthand for "the part of your brain that processes information about things you touch." Brief neuroscience tidbit: humans also have a somatosensory cortex, and different parts of it correspond to different parts of your body, such that when your hand touches something, the "hand" part of your S1 becomes activated, and when you touch something with your elbow, the "elbow" part of your S1 becomes activated, so on and so forth. If you are not familiar with this, just go Google "cortical homunculus". Go ahead, I will wait. You'll learn something interesting, such as the fact that the S1 region corresponding to your genitals is next to the region for toes, at least that's what wikipedia says.&nbsp;Anyway, each of the 4 rats receive electrical input to S1 on one side of their brain, and has recording electrodes implanted in the S1 of the opposite side of their brain, because your brain literally has two halves. Fun fact, while S1 regions process&nbsp;tactile information that comes from your body, if you stimulate it electrically, it will FEEL as if you physically felt something in that part of your body.</p><p>Another tidbit that is important for understanding this experiment: your neurons (brain cells) represent information in a variety of ways, probably in ways far more complicated than our current understanding of it. But the easiest (read: most convenient for scientists) way it does so is to increase the rate at which it fires action potentials. At this point, I realize&nbsp;those of you who have some understanding of the brain is already familiar with this, and those who are not, there isn't really a convenient way of formulating this, short of doing a full neuroscience tutorial. Okay, imagine each brain cell is a person holding one of those handheld clicker counters, the ones that&nbsp;bouncers use to keep track of how many people are inside the building. The only way for this person to communicate is to alter how fast he is clicking the clicker. Okay, I'm satisfied with that. So, in the figure, the "input" refers to electrical stimulation of S1, and "output" refers to recording of some number of neurons all clicking away. With the basics in hand, we can proceed to analyze the study.</p><p><strong>What it's not</strong><br />The easiest way to break the article down is to start&nbsp;with what this Brainet is not: it is NOT 3 rat brains connected together. On first glance, one would expect that they are connected such that rat 1's output is directly routed to rat 2, who processes the information in some manner, which then outputs the information to rat 3 through its own S1, so on and so forth. THAT would have been cool, at least for the neuroscience nerds, and that was at least what I was expecting. However, that is NOT what's happening. What is not shown in the diagram is that the input of each rat actually comes from a computer, not the preceding rat. This might not sound like a huge deal, but let's see how it is directly relevant to the "Brainet for storage and retrieval of tactile memories" experiment.</p><p>Basically, you have 3 rats in a chain, where rat 1 receives one of two patterns of electrical stimulation (call it A or B), and its brain responds in some manner, which is recorded at the output site (opposite&nbsp;S1) and the response causes stimulation of rat 2. The same thing repeats until rat 3, whose responds is then fed back to rat 1 to see if this "memory" is maintained. The cool way to do this would be, again, to route rat 1's response directly into rat 2, then from rat 2 to rat 3, then from rat 3 to rat 1, where we can see if the read-out pattern is similar to the pattern used to stimulate originally.</p><p>What actually happens, though, is the following: rat 1 is stimulated on one side of the brain using pattern A, and response in its opposite S1 is recorded. Here, unless I'm GROSSLY mistaken,&nbsp;instead of routing this response to rat 2, it is processed in a computer, whereby the neural response of rat 1 is decoded and the computer determines whether&nbsp;pattern A or B was used to stimulate. Then, based on what the computer thinks, that pattern, in its original form, is&nbsp;used to stimulate rat 2, and the same thing repeats. It's like playing broken telephone, but instead of each person passing on a distorted version of the message, there is a third person listening to you whispering your message to the next person down the table, and if the intruder&nbsp;was able to make out, say, 5 out of 10 words in the message, he would then give away the original&nbsp;untainted message instead to the next person in line. Now, it is still cool that the rat brain is able to differentially respond to the two stimuli (we will see how shortly), but it is not the rat-to-rat communication that is doing all the heavy lifting. Instead, the computer decoder is doing all the work: as long as it was able to reasonably guess the pattern, it effectively restores the message for the next rat. In my opinion, this kinda defeats the purpose of the brain-to-brain interface. In fact, it would accomplish the exact same thing by doing the message-passing procedure on the same rat 4 times. Sure, the probability of getting the message right still decreases as the chain length increases (0.5^n, where n is the number of rats), and it's impressive that the performance doesn't degrade dramatically. But by restoring the message every time it is decoded, it effectively nullifies the brain-brain communication between the rats, which is really the interesting thing here.</p><p><strong>Can our robo-rat god&nbsp;forecast weather?</strong><br />While we're out here killing dreams, let me just lay it down: the weather forecasting part is probably the most clickbait part of the whole article. You know what they say, just read the abstract. Though in this case, you probably also want to read the methods. When I think weather forecasting, I think somebody telling me the upcoming temperature and humidity based on meteorological data, and that's really not what's happening with the rats. Basically, there are two independent&nbsp;weather variables -&nbsp;a change in temperature and a change in pressure - and they are used to predict the change in precipitation probability. As such, we have two binary variables which combine into a 2-bit truth table to predict (with the logic predetermined) whether a third binary variable is an 0 or 1, in such a fashion:<br />00 -&gt; 0<br />01 -&gt; 1<br />10 -&gt; 1<br />11 -&gt; 0<br />You might recognize this as the XOR (exclusive OR) operation, doesn't really matter if you don't. I wrote them in 0s and 1s, you can just as well imagine them to be A and B.&nbsp;The point is, this is not weather forecasting, this is some extremely toyish model of how the weather works, i.e. if temperature and pressure change in opposite ways, then we predict an increase in the likelihood of precipitation. In terms of what the rats see, it is simply a combination of things we've seen before. Rat 1 is dubbed the temperature rat, who is responsible for interpreting temperature. Actually, "interpreting" might even be too strong of a word here, since literally all it's doing is that it's receiving pattern A or B (representing increase or decrease in temperature) and then re-representing it in its opposite S1 such that the decoder can make a guess of A or B. In any case, the temperature rat receives input based on temperature changes, and analogously, the pressure rat receives input based on pressure changes. They have to make "neural&nbsp;responses" such that they can be decoded, and the binary combination lead to the input of a third rat, the rain rat, being either A or B. In such a way, the Brainet predicts weather (i.e. rain)&nbsp;not to match what actually happens, but to match some predefined (and deterministic) model of how the weather works, as prescribed by humans. In other words, it's not predicting weather.</p><p><strong>All is not lost</strong><br />Well, now that I've disappointed you thoroughly, I will end on a positive note.&nbsp;In my personal opinion, The most intriguing part of the study comes in the form of the group two-choice discrimination task (second experiment, "Brainet for stimulus classification"). In this experiment, all 4 rats are effectively unconnected. They do, however, receive the same input simultaneously: all As or all Bs. The task of the Brainet is to make a neural response in its output (opposite) S1 to indicate whether the whole gang was presented with A or B. The way they do this is quite interesting. To indicate A, the rats have to "synchronize" their brain activity, which means changing the firing rate (clicks per second, remember?) of the output neurons to match the rest of the group (the average of the 3 other rats, to be exact), over some period of time. This could be straightforward, as they could all choose to click really fast, for a second, as soon as they perceive stimulus A, hence increasing the average response, leading to an increased similarity of everyone's activity (the formal measure used is correlation, where R&gt;0.2 successfully indicate "A"). This wouldn't be all that exciting in itself, because the increase in activity could simply be&nbsp;a natural response to being electrically stimulated (though they did appropriate controls to rule against this possibility).&nbsp;</p><p>The interesting part is how they indicate stimulus B: instead of synchronizing their activity, they have to desynchronize. In other words, each rat has to respond differently than the average of the 3 other rats. Mathematically, this corresponds to having a correlation coefficient of less than 0.2. If 3 out of the 4 rats achieve this decrease in correlation coefficient, then the stimulus is effectively decoded as being "B". So the question is, &nbsp;how do the rats organize themselves to react differently, provided that this decrease in correlation is not some mathematical artifact?&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine there are 4 of us, and each of us is told to pick a number between 1 to 10. If we want to blindly "synchronize", we could simply all pick the largest or smallest value possible, until we are rewarded. But to pick as differently from each other as possible? That's quite a feat.&nbsp;According to the setup, the 4 rats are physically isolated, but with a transparent plexiglass door, which presumably enables visual/audio communication between the 4?&nbsp;Short of this, I really don't know how the 4 of them can blindly work out a way to desynchronize. Again, this is assuming that having a correlation coefficient of &lt;0.2 in 3 of 4 rats don't happen often purely through chance, trusting in their statistical analysis of the baseline probability. Unless I'm grossly misinterpreting the study (in which case, somebody should let me know), this is definitely the biggest mystery of the study, and the mechanism of this (de)synchronization&nbsp;should have been the focus of investigation. Instead, the rest of the study was based on&nbsp;some fairly gimmicky extensions of the same idea, without further exploring how exactly the social interaction between the four rats enabled their neural communication, which the paper claims to be a big deal in its abstract.&nbsp;</p><p>Alas, this paper demonstrates an&nbsp;important point on reading scientific literature: don't (always) judge a study by its abstract. As always, if anyone feels inclined to discuss or debate the outcomes and interpretations of this study, I am all ears. Same goes for comments and concerns.</p><p>[1]&nbsp;<span style="font-size:16px">Pais-Vieira, M.&nbsp;</span><em>et al.</em><span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;Building an organic computing device with multiple interconnected brains.&nbsp;</span><em>Sci.

      <title>Questions drive science. Why not science class?</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/16/questions-drive-science-why-not-science-class</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I went to another talk in the Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind (KIBM) seminar series at UCSD last night (<a href="http://www.salk.edu/faculty/allen.html">Nicola Allen</a>). The title of her talk was "Astrocyte Regulation of Synapse Formation in the Brain", or something to that effect. The talk, as interesting and amazing as it was, is not the purpose of today's writing, though I will take two paragraph to summarize it because it serves as the basis for the point I want to make. If neuroscience turns you off, I urge you to keep reading because you're my intended audience, the sun always shines after the storm, and that this isn't really about neuroscience.</p><p>We typically think of the brain as consisting of two families of cells, neurons and neuroglias (or simply glias). Neurons are the tiny buggers that communicate to each other through firing of action potentials across synapses, which are connections between neurons, kind of like a stream of 0's and 1's going between the wires in your computer right now. Neurons make you think, perceive, and form just about anything that is "you". Glials, on the other hand, were thought of padding, its name literally comes from the word GLUE in Latin.&nbsp;Naturally, then, neuroscience has been devoting most of its manpower to the study of neurons, because studying glials would be like studying the shell of your laptop in trying to determine how your computer computes - not that they're not important, since they have a variety of functions like keeping your neurons alive and, well, comfortably padded, but they just aren't the things that make you tick.</p><p>With me so far? This is where it goes downhill, fast, and it's where the talk begins. Astrocytes, a subtype of glia, are apparently more important than we thought: if you grow neurons in a dish without astrocytes, they won't form synapses, which essentially means that they are deaf and dumb, and can't do any meaningful calculations. This implies that not only do astrocytes support the functioning of neurons, they also directly impact their growth. Nicola Allen's lab, then, is interested in how exactly do astrocytes regulate this important aspect of neural development. The (very, very, very) brief version of the story is: they isolated the chemical soup astrocytes secrete, dumped it on the neurons to see if they end up growing correctly (they do). Then, from the thousands of proteins present, they isolated ~25 suspects, tested their effect (positive again), and then again isolated it to a single candidate, called glypican4, that was primarily responsible for the effect observed in in-vitro neuron development. Well, I described in one sentence what was probably two years of lab work and countless formulations of ingenious methodologies, but the story doesn't end. Apparently, glypican4 isn't wholly responsible for the formation of synapses, they just induced the surfacing of GluA1 receptors (they're like the receivers of data packets) in postsynaptic neurons, which then triggers some downstream effects in the neurons themselves to form the physical synapse, which they had no explanation for. Worse yet, if you reproduce this effect in-vivo through knockout of the glypican4 gene in a baby mouse, the mouse brain is first screwed up because, as we expected, there are a lack of synapses in development. But after about 3 weeks, the brain compensates and completely fixes itself.... And I think this is where I'll stop.</p><p>If I haven't lost you here, I'd like to talk to you, because you probably know a lot more about things than I do. But here is what seems to be the take away: they've isolated this one little protein molecule that is probably one link in the chain of neural development out of hundreds, and they've actually proven that the brain doesn't even need it. This little obscure fact, along with the painstaking methodology, will probably end up on a page in an entry level neuroscience textbook someday, where an unfortunate undergraduate soul is going to have to spend 20 minutes reading and memorizing for his class. If I was such an unfortunate soul, I would have said: "Fuck this thing. Why does anyone even care? They didn't even find a good answer, why do I need to know this?" I know, because I, like countless of my comrades, were such an unfortunate soul, throughout highschool, undergrad, all the way until my salvation on Commencement. That pretty much summed up my attitude towards basic sciences, especially biology, where 99% of the times, people seem to find one irrelevant molecule after another that contributes to a total sum of zero increase in understanding of science or improvement in the quality of life. How many no-name molecule is published for every insulin and penicilin? And why are all of them compiled in <a class="hoverZoomLink" href="http://www.uz.zgora.pl/~jleluk/animacje/show_thumbnails.pl2_files/pathway-2b.png">this</a> cellular mechanism diagram that I need to memorize? A better question: why am I in graduate school?</p><p>After that little (okay, long) rant, you'd think that it was the biggest waste of two hours in my life, hearing about the trials and tribulations of discovering this little molecule, on top of the fact that my knowledge in basic biology was stretched so thin that it was like I was trying to keep up with the same seminar in Russian.</p><p>But it wasn't. I held on for my dear life during the two hours, but it wasn't the endless stream of "interesting" facts that kept me awake at 7pm on a full weekday, it was my own stream of questions that had me going, hoping that I would get some answers, question after question. But more often than not, there would be no answers, or worse, an answer that lead to even more questions. In the end, it piqued my interest so much that I went home and found the very papers that I thought I hated, detailing the discovery of one no-name molecule after another, just so I can find out more. And that change of attitude, I think, is the key that can take our science to the next level. I know, because I was once a non-believer.</p><p>Seriously though, yes I was interested in neuroscience in the first place, and I think some entry level curiosity and knowledge are prerequisites, but to be honest, even if you didn't know a thing about the context of the talk, there are definitely things that can make you wonder, logistic things, purely along the lines of "if you did this, why didn't you do that?" Or, "what if you did this instead?" I publicly embarrassed myself within 5 minutes of sitting down, during the first few slide of the talk. The slide was showing two plates of neurons, one with astrocytes, one without, and she was beginning to explain the effect of the lack of astrocytes. With profound speed, I managed to raise my hand and ask: "but what happens when there are no neurons?" To which I immediately realized, then there would be an empty plate. But my stupid question was rooted by a deeper, less stupid question, which was what effects do the neurons have on the astrocytes? Which she thankfully realized, and gave some answers later on in the talk. The point of that anecdote is to say that, you don't need to be a neuroscientist to ask neuroscience questions.</p><p>Many people- more eloquent people- have written about the fact that science, as we know, is a never-ending process, and not something with "answers". But I'm still going to write my two cents. A lot of my friends were blessed with the intelligence and audacity to realize that fact earlier on in their lives, but I wasn't. I took high school physics and chemistry like it was the effing Holy Bible. "Surely we have the atomic model down pat by now, after 2000 years. Right? Right?" Imagine my surprise when I took quantum mechanics, an area which by definition has little certainty in anything, but it still somehow managed to overthrow the planetary model of electrons orbiting around the nucleus. I'm telling you, I literally thought there were electrons circling the protons and neutrons in perfect spherical trajectories.</p><p>Now one might think that this is my personal lament with the way I was taught science, and to a point, it is. But I'm confident to say that I wasn't the only one with this experience, because I've seen many curious people turn away from science, drowning in the sea of seemingly meaningless facts. In fact, every single kid between the age of 3 and 10 I've known had tremendous ability to ask questions about the world around them. Fun fact, every time I go to a museum or aquarium or some kind of science exhibit, there seems to be a school trip, and it always amazes me to hear the kind of questions these kids ask. And it's not like they're always gifted classes. I remember this one incident very clearly: I was in Chicago and decided to drop by the aquarium, and there was a field trip for inner-city school kids, I swear I saw some of the gnarliest 10-year-old's ever. But as soon as they saw the fish and the turtles and the frogs, all they had was questions. It was so strange to me that a kid with his pants halfway down his knees was filling out one of those lame-ass question sheets we get every time we go on a field trip, and asking the animal handlers for the answers! Anyway, that's my feel-good story, and I've always maintained that kids all have the ability to be very very smart, just due to the sheer amount of curiosity they have. But somewhere down the line, we become less curious. Maybe because we get busy, but let's be real, despite what you thought as a 12-year-old, you were not busy. I think, it's because school is fucking boring.</p><p>Not that the other subjects are any better, but let's just focus on science for now. We all know how science class goes. "Alright class, today we're gonna cover the X model of Y, and you'll need to know ABC for this unit's test." It's just appalling that we're taking the most exciting part of science - the narratives, the struggles and triumphs, and the uncertainty- OUT of science. You might think that the narratives have no place in relation to disseminating the knowledge we gathered, but I argue that if it's the only thing that can keep students engaged and awake, then we better make some damn place for it. It's like saying, if someone was to ask me what the last book of Harry Potter was about, then I should literally read to them the sentence I'm currently on, with no context of the past nor expectation of the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, I don't have an answer for this. I'm not sure if the responsibility falls upon the students, the educators, or even scientists - probably a little bit of everyone. But I'm glad the student-based learning thing is catching on now, especially in some higher-level institutions. And I don't think it's perfect the way it is, but nobody said it was. The tl:dr?</p><p>1. We should encourage students to ask questions about science, just like how scientists ask questions about science. Not just questions in the sense of "I don't understand this", but more "why is this the way it is?", or better yet, the dreaded "why are we studying this?" I swear, half the time scientists don't even give shit about the particular thing that they are studying, in the sense that what matters more is having their curiosity satisfied, and not a particular contribution. Obviously people care about the things they're investigating, at least in the grand scheme of things, but sometimes, when the going gets tough, the little wins matter more.&nbsp;</p><p>2. We should tell the stories of science - how it got here and where it's going - and not just the conclusions. Because first, there aren't conclusions, even the things we learn in high school science are still being turned over. And two, because people like narratives much more than isolated facts. Obviously this requires in-depth background knowledge of the particular subject, and science teachers, bless their hearts, may not always have the prerequisites. Worse yet, you don't need to love science, or even be good at it, to teach it. I was pretty lucky in having some teachers in high school that actually thought science was cool, which is always a great start, but not every kid gets that either.</p><p>So, my friends, if you're on the way to becoming a science teacher, or even a professor, please, think of Harry Potter and how sad you would be if that story had no narrative or cliffhangers.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Seminar Reflection - Complementary Learning Systems</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/9/11/seminar-reflection-complementary-learning-systems</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yesterday over lunch, I was lamenting over the fact that all these damn papers I read seem to not go anywhere permanent in my brain. I mean, I can recall one when I read the title and tell you what it's about and its key findings, but I can't spontaneously do it, without trigger. Whether this is normal or not, and I have a hunch that it is, I don't really care, all I want to do is remember the things I read and be able to wield these facts in a meaningful manner.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Lo and behold, I watched my first online research talk yesterday afternoon, held at UCSD no less. The talk was given by Dr. Jay McClelland from Stanford. I personally am not familiar with his work at all, though that's decidedly my problem (I think he's pretty famous in the field). The talk though, piqued my interest a few weeks ago when I first received the promo email (and about 5 more after that first one)&nbsp;for the lecture series. The talk, and I'm directly quoting, is about the <a target="_blank" href="http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/research/DNS/speakers/McClelland.html">complementary learning systems</a> in the brain, the supposed "fast" and "slow" learning systems and how they interact with each other to form new memories. Here, I shall attempt to regurgitate everything I heard yesterday. Why? You will see at the end.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But before I start, I have to make a very important disclaimer that <strong>1)</strong> this (obviously) isn't my work, and I'm literally recalling from my memory as to what he said, and <strong>2)</strong> since I didn't write this (I mean, I'm WRITING it, but more like making a transcript), I don't have any of the sources he provided, like I usually try to do for my science-y posts. At one point or another, I most definitely WILL visit the literature he's citing, but not today, because I need to write this today, and there are, like always, about 100 papers cited in the talk, which I actually find very nice since it means I get to skip all the boring literature review. And actually, the major portion of the talk was a setup of our current knowledge, which is what I found most interesting. Not that his actual work wasn't interesting, it's just...unassuming, if that's the right word.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The POINT is, read on at your own discretion, and take away what you will. I took it in good faith that his sources are valid, but in no way should you, nor should you trust in my ability to recall what he said.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1410447633012_47100">&nbsp; &nbsp; The complementary learning systems refer to two distinct masses of structures in the brain. The canonically "fast system" refers to the hippocampus (HPC), or the entirety of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) - this is sort of in the middle/core area of your brain, away from the outer cortices, if you think of it as a sphere. We know it's associated with fast learning because it's important in forming short term memories. The evidence for this comes from lesion studies, which is a fancy way of saying removing it, where patients without sections of the HPC loses the ability to make new semantic memories (facts) almost completely, while their ability to form procedural (learned abilities, like juggling) memories stay intact. One specific patient is very famous for this, and he goes by the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison" data-cke-saved-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison" target="_blank">Henry Molaison</a>, or H.M, prior to his death.&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1410447633012_77209">&nbsp; &nbsp; The other part of the complementary system is the neocortex, which is a quite broad umbrella that includes e.g. your frontal lobe, temporal lobe, etc. Basically, these places are the permanent storage of the &nbsp;things you know about life - apple is red, sky is blue, I live in Toronto, etc. It's said that the neocortex learns new facts extremely slowly, on the order of weeks, and this comes from rat studies, I believe. Also, before going further, it was stated that the "connectionist" assumption is required, which says that memories, or information in general, are stored in the particular pattern that neurons are connected, and hence, activated. It seems to me like that's the basis of neuroscience, but it's cool to be reminded that that, in fact, is still an assumption, simply one that is heavily subscribed to.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So how do these two systems play with each other? Well, one theory is that while the neocortex holds the known information, any new information is first represented in the MTL. And there's a stage called memory consolidation, which sees the transfer of knowledge, if you will, from the MTL to the neocortex. Several findings suggest this, which are actually pretty cool. For one rat experiment, it's been reported that during sleep, the hippocampus plays back the memory that the rat experienced during the day, in the pattern very similar to the activation. This alone doesn't seal the deal, since it could just be played back...for fun? It doesn't necessarily need an audience, and who's to say the audience IS the neocortex, as the recipient of the new memory. Alas, crude as they are, lesion studies often prove the most enlightening. It was found that in experiments where the rat needs to memorize a certain pattern, like routes in a maze or something, those with this short term memory intact can perform well on the same task the next day. But if you remove the hippocampus soon after the initial learning, the rat suddenly doesn't know what to do anymore. In other words, the later you remove the hippocampus, the better the rat is able to perform. This is pretty convincingly in favor of the idea that the MTL is, in fact, a temporary storage for new memories, and &nbsp;this was my first big takeaway: <strong>new memories don't consolidate in the cortex right away, and if you want something to stick, you have to keep at it for a while</strong>. Because while the hippocampus acts as a short term storage, the amount of new things we learn every day is of course greater than what the buffer can hold - IF you're forgetting things, that is. Totally not saying that this is scientifically correct, but I'm relating this "fact" to the effectiveness of repetitions in learning, and the common saying that you need 21 days for a habit to form. I guess this means I have to keep reading the same paper for a while...&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This model was all fine and dandy, until a new experiment showed that if the new thing being learned is not completely new, and that it relates (conceptually or semantically) somehow to existing knowledge, then the rat's ability to permanently store this knowledge becomes much greater, i.e. faster consolidation to long term memory, less affected by HPC lesion. This next part I'm a bit fuzzy on, but it was shown that there is an increase of chemical expression (or was it gene?) during the consolidation of new memories, and for the 3 different memory conditions - completely new, new but related, completely old - the "new but related" condition (the rat, more accurately) showed the highest increase in the expression of this thing that I forgot. The point is, and this was my second big takeaway: <strong>learning new things is easier and faster if they are related to old things, or rather, if you have a conceptual model already in place.&nbsp;</strong>This seems intuitive from our everyday experiences, but why should it be true from a neuroscience perspective? Furthermore, it is in disagreement from the neat separation that hippocampus is for short term storage, and neocortex is for long term storage.&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1410447633012_132382">&nbsp; &nbsp; So the above was all background, and I believe Dr. McClelland's new work is in demonstrating this finding in an artificial neural network. In a network representing semantically represented things (e.g bird-can-fly, tree-is-plant), upon the insertion of a new item, it was found that the new item can be integrated faster and with less disruption to the original network if it's similar to an existing concept. In other words, adding "salmon" to this network of semantic concepts is easier if, say, "trout" already exists, both in terms of integrating "salmon", as well as not screwing up the known relations such that it says something stupid like fish-can-fly...until you try to add flying fish anyway. I think this is very cool, in that the artificial network can magically mimic its biological counterpart- I say magic not to be cheeky, but to say that there is no reason that the artificial and the biological SHOULD match, because it's not for certain that our biological neural network is even represented accurately by the artificial, not in the current framework at least.&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; That concludes my regurgitation, as you can see, it's very rough and missing quite a few pieces of crucial information. But the reason I was adamant in writing it down was exactly in accordance with my first takeaway: that repetition aids memory formation. I totally didn't have to write it on my public blog, because who knows who will take this misinformation and runaway to say something completely unjustified. But in the end, my conscience is kosher because of all the "DON'T TAKE WHAT I SAY HERE TO BE TRUE" qualifiers I put down, because I don't have the pressure to write anything actually useful (lol) and prescriptive like most pop science websites do. DO check out the sources if you're interested, a great place to start: James McClelland. I'll try to come back and put in some papers at the bottom of this once I do my own research, if I remember (and that's a BIG if). Also, as always, feel free to tell me that you thought of something interesting while reading, or that I was right or wrong or whatever, or that I'm an idiot (but you won't be adding anything new). &nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>We are our 10%</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/2/we-are-the-10</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Pause whatever you're doing (which is reading), if you haven't seen this<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVt32qoyhi0"> trailer</a>, you should check it out right now. It's worth it, I'll wait- but don't go on a YouTube spree!</p><p>...</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Back? Cool. Morgan Freeman says, and I quote: "it is estimated most human beings only use 10% of the brain's capacity, imagine if we could access 100%, interesting things begin to happen." This misconception, then, is the topic of our discussion today. First of all, any professor of neuroscience caught saying that should be shot on the spot. Actually, no, any person that's not Morgan Freeman. Why? Because Morgan Freeman is god. If there's a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_percent_of_brain_myth">Wikipedia page</a> dedicated to calling it a myth [1], then it probably is.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In all seriousness, this factoid is not true. Absolutely nothing interesting at all will happen if and when we access 100% of our brain, because we do it on a daily basis. Perhaps not simultaneously, but we definitely have the capability to access most, if not all, of our brain tissue. We know this because the brain is metabolically active at all times (if not, you'd be dead), and we can record constant electrical output on a sub-second scale. I won't bother citing research for this, you can Google "fMRI brain" and see for yourselves. Or check out the Wikipedia article, and to save you the trouble, here's the first (legit) source it cites, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/people-only-use-10-percent-of-brain/">Scientific American</a>&nbsp;[2].&nbsp;To put it crudely, you probably recruit more than 10% of your brain when you try to take a poop (uncited, though this will make an awesome xkcd what-if segment). Therefore, as a budding graduate student in cognitive neuroscience, I absolutely do not endorse this myth, nor do I believe in it.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; That being said, here's the interesting thought of today: what would it even mean to access only 10% of our brain, i.e. what is our metric? By mass and volume, the cerebellum alone is on the order of a tenth of our brain, which means that if you're breathing, awake, and pumping blood, you are probably accessing 10% of your brain. I could make a joke here about that's pretty much all that you do, so the myth is actually not a myth, but I won't. In addition, if we consider that our peripheral nervous system (PNS) is made up of roughly the same stuff as our brain (neurons, lol), then by definition, we possess above average intellect by simply walking, and you'd be approaching genius if you could teach me how to Dougie.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Jesting aside, this should absolutely convince you that we are indeed using more than 10% of our brains, metabolically speaking. But despite my best attempt to stay scientific, something about that myth speaks to me on an intuitive level- which I believe is also the reason why it has become such a popular idea in our society- and that is the notion that some individuals are smarter than others. By smarter I mean more practiced in all kinds of different intelligences: logical, emotional, musical, etc. If we compare ourselves to a genius like Einstein or Mozart, we naturally want to blame our own lack of brain usage as the reason why we're not churning out theories of relativity or symphonies on the daily. Furthermore, the fact that any individual has the ability to improve in a cognitive or physical task seems to imply that we CAN "access" more of our brain, if we so choose- again, "more" is up for interpretation here. This, however, may be due to a lack of understanding of the way we "learn" things, as well as what makes one person receive math, for example, much more readily than another. These questions have been investigated and, thankfully, steadily answered in recent years, to a point where we understand that it's not that we're using more brain, per se, but that we're making existing neuronal connections more stable and reliable (this is quite a gross generalization, but accurate for the most part, at least to my limited knowledge).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Going down this road, if we take "the ability to perform ___", i.e. behavioral measure, as a measure of our brain capacity, then by all means, we're not using much of our brain, at least not to the extent of our potential. It is my personal belief that with practice and guidance, we can do most things fairly well, at least relative to not being able to at all (especially evident in that one neighbor learning to play the clarinet). If we so desire, we can also cite "connectivity in ___ pathway" as our metric, provided that we can pinpoint the task-network correlation (a whole other can of worms). Simply put, if we know that neurons X-Y-Z are involved in producing oil paintings, then we can just measure their connectivity at any given point to measure our "brain capacity for oil paintings". (Again, this is hypothetical because we can't do this yet, not to mention a particular mapping is highly individualized, also not to mention there probably aren't neural networks responsible for "oil painting", but I digress.) Then, the case of 100% capacity, full global connectivity&nbsp;in our example, would actually be quite interesting. Research suggest that neuronal hyperconnectivity links to abnormal states such as epilepsy (seizures) [3] and autism [4,5], so our thought experiment probably wouldn't end well. Well, you might end up with a poofed up brain like MegaMind,&nbsp;due to the sheer volume of axons you might need to connect every neuron with each other...if you're into that kind of stuff.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My wish for a fantastical brain is still unsatisfied, however. Maybe the key is not that we're not using all of our brain, but that we're not using a whole lot of it together for any particular task. In other words, all the departments of your whole company (your brain) must be communicating effectively and synchronously in order to maximize efficiency. We see some evidence of that in [6], where it was found that functional connectivity (co-activity, or, co-"access") between two regions was correlated with a verbal working memory task performance. This study is particularly interesting to me for another reason, which is that neither of the two regions of interest investigated was the canonical one for working memory, i.e. prefrontal cortex area (behind your forehead), but rather two regions in what's called a "default mode network". More on that in a separate post later, for sure. But the point here is that, even with the limited conclusions we can draw about such a specific task, there may be some validity in what I was suggesting: simultaneous recruitment could imply better performance. This means... more reading for me, yay!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The last bit I want you to consider is the fact that we can essentially see much more than the visible light spectrum, compared to 50 years ago. In fact, we use a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum on a daily basis- through our computers, cellphones, etc. You might say that that's cheating, because a cellphone is external to our brain, but our brains had to undergo significant adaptation to learn how to use such a device. Furthermore, what if it was directly connected to the brain? We know that the brain has a quasi-magical ability to integrate and use foreign systems, as well as compensate for lost parts with intact parts. So it's not inconceivable that we'd be able to experience much more than what we were born with. Finally- and this is what will catapult this post into the "metaphysical rambling" category- what if we already possess such abilities, but are simply unaware of it consciously. I'm not saying that we can actually interact with radio waves, a la Lucy in the movie trailer, in any meaningful way. But we all have this gut feeling that we can't quite consciously describe, perhaps it's another set of sensory experience that we're not aware of. What if our instincts, or our sixth/seventh/nth sense, are just untapped from a consciousness perspective? If an eel can sense electric fields through biological sensors, who says we can't?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Please don't kick me out of graduate school or jail me for radical ideals, I swear I'll carry on doing acceptable research, but a dreamer can dream right?</p><p class="text-align-center">_____</p><p>[1]&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px">Wikipedia contributors.

      <title>Year 1 (Part I)</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/9/8/year-1-part-1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am now in the 52nd week of being in San Diego, so this marks an excellent opportunity to document my first year of graduate school. I'd also just realized, I started drafting a reflection a month after I got here, back in November of last year, in hopes of summarizing my experiences for all my fans to see then. Alas, that document has been sitting in the draft box since then, with nary a word in it. Hey, blame it on grad school.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before I get started, I just want to say that, I've read a few really excellent (and some not so good) guides on how to be a (successful /happy /living) PhD student in the recent months - and this is not one of those. I am not advising anyone on how to be a graduate student because, well,&nbsp;I largely haven't figured out. But more importantly, individual experiences in grad school vary hugely because not only does it depend on a range of external factors such as the school, the city, climate, lab/advisor relationship (the list goes on), but more importantly, your own personality and mindset going in. In fact, this past year of tremendous intellectual and personal freedom was more of an opportunity to learn about myself, than about how to grad school. With that said, let's delve into Book 1: Richard Gao and the Elusive Specialty.</p><p><strong>What Graduate School Is Not (and Is)</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before getting into what graduate school is, I figure I will start with what graduate school is not, because I know what it's not and the millions of fortunate souls not in graduate school has no idea: <strong>graduate school is not school.&nbsp;</strong>Weird, right? Because why the hell would someone call it graduate school if it's not really school, and if it's not school, what is it? The best analogy I can think of for a graduate student is someone working full time at a startup company while having to attend mandatory training sessions, except, at hours comparable to a full-time arts degree in college (or quarter-time in engineering... :] ). Some schools/departments require rotations in 2 or 3 research labs before committing to joining one, but after someone adopts you, your primary responsibility is working for said lab, which can include a variety of things like reading, designing experiments, running analysis, or god forbid, culturing cells (and it's macroscopic equivalent,&nbsp;running undergrads in psychology &amp; cognitive experiments).</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The usefulness of the courses themselves range from [VERY, BUT ONLY 5-10 LECTURES WORTH], to [NOT AT ALL], and it's up to the graduate student to a) fill gaps in his or her knowledge via attending these courses, and more importantly, b) jump through hoops to satisfy departmental requirements. You DO learn things,&nbsp;but by and large, nobody gives a single shit whether you actually learn anything in these classes, which, now that I think about it, is surprisingly similar to undergraduate classes. Obviously you (and your advisor) hope that you can obtain useful skills and knowledge that will push you forward and onto unexpected paths in your research, but if classes are the only means of you learning, then something is no bueno. All that being said, some people -&nbsp;and I shamefully admit that I am one such person -&nbsp;have a pathological need to do well in courses, no matter how trivial, knowing full well that it's worth as much as ..uh nothing AND that getting straight A's doesn't actually mean that they've learned anything. All I can say here is: I'm a victim brotha, even my conditioning has been conditioned.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway,&nbsp;think of it like this: when you start your brand new job, you have to go through training modules, some more unpleasant than others. As much as we all hate WHMIS, some of the things you learn IS useful and could potentially save your ass (literally). But just because you did WHIMS, doesn't mean you will be any good at your actual job. And the mandatory units you have to satisfy for some arbitrarily defined breadth requirement, well, those are like having to take workplace conflict resolution training, except anywhere between 3 to 5 times in the year. But taking those training modules isn't really the same thing as being "in school".&nbsp;To extend this analogy, you are the unfortunate employee, your lab is the company you actually work for and pay you, and your school is the government which makes money by providing you these training modules that are kinda okay except for the fact that for every dollar your company pays you, they have to pay the government a dollar too so you can be certified for something that the government actually has no idea whether you can or cannot do. It's even more confusing because your school pays your supervisor.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When Is My Summer Vacation</strong><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in the past year have asked me this, so it deserves its own section. Offending parties include well-meaning people like your family not in grad school, significant other not in grad school, friends not in grad school, random strangers not in grad school...pretty much anybody not in grad school and think that you are "in school". There are really two answers to this, and depending on whether you feel like clarifying, which has the unintended effect of triggering a follow-up question that I will shortly discuss, you can go with either one.&nbsp;</p><p>Short answer: July.<br />Long answer:&nbsp;Never.</p><p>Short answer: My summer vacation starts when I don't have classes anymore, i.e. when I don't have an institutional obligation to be at school anymore, which, in my case, is July to October.&nbsp;<br />Long answer:&nbsp;My summer vacation? Well, I work at a startup full-time but also take classes full-time. And when I don't have to go to class, I still work at the start-up full-time...But I get vacation time?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Actually, there are some more variations here. A lot of people stay back in the summer to do research, if there is funding, and especially if there are projects to be completed. But some people stay back to be a teaching assistant for the summer to get paid and take a break from working in the lab. And others actually just take the summer off to travel or explore other interests, or maybe even work as a visiting scholar somewhere else. It largely depends on the needs of your lab (aka employer),&nbsp;your personal preference, and how the money flows, but working as a researcher seems to be the most common, at least in my experience. The thing is, if you're into research,&nbsp;summer is the only undisturbed time you have to actually do any work, at least in the first two years. In other words, you love your job, you really want to spend time on it, and you get 3 or 4 months a year where you finally don't have to go to fucking WHMIS 12 hours a week anymore, what the hell else would you do other than to do your job? Ironically enough, as much as I was gung-ho about doing actual work this summer, I ended up largely absent from the lab, though the good thing about working on a computer is that you can do it anywhere...theoretically.</p><p><strong>How Do I Pay For School</strong><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Graduate school has possibly the most absurd payment structure, but the short answer is: I don't pay to go to school, and I get paid to be a researcher. For most PhD students, enrolling in a PhD program comes with "funding", and usually quoted at a handsome enough figure. Looking at this figure, you might actually feel like your bachelor-level education is appropriately appreciated here, at least more so than your local Starbucks does. The problem is that the institution (school) usually takes more than half of that handsome figure for tuition and fees, before it ever makes it into your bank account,&nbsp;leaving you to wonder whether Starbucks is such a bad choice afterall. In reality, graduate students receive a net salary of 20-30k a year, and that money can come from a variety of ways, such as you working as a researcher (your primary role), external funding, or working as a teaching assistant. Some of these are obviously better than others, as far as extra responsibility goes:&nbsp;being paid by your boss feels like you're a functioning member of society contributing to scientific endeavor, being paid through government funding feels like you're the prince of paupers and that your work might be somewhat interesting even though the market dictates that not only do you not have a minimum wage, you actually have a maximum wage, and finally, being paid through working as a TA feels like you're a monk journeying through the countryside preaching your wisdom to a group of people whose collective fucks barely sum up to the 5th decimal place, but you have to because otherwise you'll starve.&nbsp;I joke. It's not that bad. There are always bright undergrads who you fear might make you look like a bumbling fool in front of the whole class, but the sentiment remains - it's not a well paid job.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I enjoyed teaching a lot, especially if I get to help teach a subject that I happen to want to learn about. I TAed an entry-level statistics class this past year and boy did it help me professionally. It's only a shame because every class, I stare into their soulless eyes and think, oh you will wish you learned this stuff the first time around. But that's only because the first time I took stats, it was like a competition between me and this one senior professor, who was presumably evaluating my professor's teaching capabilities,&nbsp;to see who can fall asleep the fastest. Also, graduate student pay is by far the most complained-about topic for all graduate students, because, for real, it's not that great. But to be honest, it beats working at Starbucks, and you might even save some if you live real frugally by doing creative things. Like drinking Soylent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is an excerpt from a recent post on Wait But Why (see full - in all senses of the word "full" - post, <a target="_blank" href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html">here</a>) :</p><figure>
  <blockquote>
    <span>&#147;</span>The harm caused is now an unaccounted-for cost, also known as a negative externality, and my incentives are no longer aligned with the customer’s best interests. If all I care about is greed and maximizing profit, I will continue to use the chemical, because I’m economically incentivized to do so.<br/><br/>This kind of negative externality is how tobacco companies got away with murder for so many decades. The long-term cost to customers’ health was unaccounted for because customers were ignorant to the consequences, the negative effects were years away, and there was no regulatory penalty in place to charge for the harm. Thinking purely from a greed-optimizing perspective, cigarette companies acted completely rationally. They kicked up nicotine levels in cigarettes and added shards of glass into filters to create tiny cuts and increase nicotine absorption, which caused further harm but increased demand—but since the harm was unaccounted for, this was a pure net positive for the company. And when anti-tobacco campaigns started to educate customers on cigarette harm—which attaches the harm to the cost of scared customers and lower demand—the tobacco industry hired low-integrity scientists to discredit the negative campaigns and muddle the message. Awareness would get there eventually, but the longer they could delay and keep the harm hidden, the better off they’d be from a greed standpoint.<br/><br/>People call this evil, but all it really is is an industry acting in its own best interests within the parameters of its environment. Greed is a simple motivation—it takes whatever it can get, and it’ll push all available limits it can in order to fully optimize. I used tobacco companies as an example, but you could easily tell the story with fast food, radiation-emitting consumer electronics, politician behavior, the finance industry, and many others.<span>&#148;</span>
  </blockquote>

</figure><p>This topic probably deserves its own full post at some point, but I just couldn't not take down this quote because it largely summarized a recurring conversation I had with many good friends in the last few months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We face this kind of moral questions on a daily basis, though at a much smaller scale for us regular-Joes-and-Janes. We tend to think of these corporations and specific industries as "evil", or the driving force of social and environmental instability. In reality, it's just a bunch of regular Joes and Janes sitting on the (extremely) long end of a seesaw, catapulting the world across from them - not by malicious intent, but by something as natural as gravity: our own greed. Not that I don't think Joes and Janes in positions of power shouldn't act responsibly and, dare I say it, "morally". I just think that, having been born into a culture where personal greed is heroically exemplified, it would require taking some adult classes on moving away from the default.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>You don't know what foodporn is.</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/7/28/you-dont-know-what-foodporn-is</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you spend 3 hours&nbsp;making&nbsp;a nice homemade meal, don't hashtag it foodporn,&nbsp;appreciate it.&nbsp;That's like&nbsp;foodcommitment or foodrelationship or at least foodsex. Same thing with dropping a week's paycheque at a restaurant, that's more like foodescort. Real foodporn is all about maximizing some specific utility of food while being as far away from real food as possible. You might ask yourself if you even ate, because it happened so fast and you're pretty sure that's not what real food is supposed to be like, but you don't care anyway cuz sometimes you just gotta do what you gotta do.</p><p>Okay this&nbsp;analogy is getting a bit out of hand. I present to you:&nbsp;the real foodporn.</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/55b70f58e4b07c9d90779ba2/1438060398814//img.jpg" alt="Soylent. Truly, #foodporn."/> Soylent. Truly, #foodporn.[/caption]


<p>What is that you say? That, my friend, is a bag of graduate-student-fuel, good for 3 meals. Otherwise known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.soylent.com">Soylent</a>. For those of you that are not familiar with this modern miracle, it is a meal replacement powder that touts itself as nutritionally complete. In fact, it's more like a "meal" than a "meal replacement". You can check out their story on the website, but basically, the guy that invented this was tired of wasting time cooking real food everyday, so like every good engineer, he drew a blackbox over what used to be "meals" and tried to come up with its equivalent. I wouldn't be surprise if he literally drew an input-output diagram at some point and labelled the filter function as "food". I guess in that case the food would be input and your stomach would be the filter...&nbsp;In any case, he found all the daily-required nutrients and mixed them up, sustained himself for thirty days with nothing but that magical powder and water. After successfully not dying,&nbsp;he proceeded to call it the most unfortunate (or ironic) name you could possibly give it (if you don't know, Google "soylent green", spoiler: it's made of people) and started a Kickstarter campaign to commercialize it. It was so well-received&nbsp;that people gave him $750,000 so they, too, can stop eating real food and just drink goo.</p><p>Why am I writing about it? Well, I'd actually heard about this when it came out and I was working&nbsp;at Interaxon around the time, having very similar food conundrums as that dude. But, I remember thinking to myself, golly, that's another modern miracle that I'd never experiment with.&nbsp;Fast forward two years to&nbsp;March 2015. I'm 8 months into a PhD and decided that fresh groceries in La Jolla,&nbsp;California is so ridiculously expensive that I'd rather eat out everyday for lunch and still break even and save tons of time from cooking. After just a week of eating sodium-packed and fat-dripped campus food (only for lunch!!!), though, I felt bloated, lethargic, and pretty much hated myself and the limited selection of food vendors on campus. I don't remember how exactly, but this&nbsp;miraculous powder popped back into my life (like all other good things, probably over Facebook), and this time around, I decided that not experimenting is for whimps and pretty much YOLO. Also, two years without a lawsuit or news headline saying "dumbass died because he drank powder for a month" was thumbs up enough for me. So, I went ahead and ordered a box of 7 bags, which is conveniently 7x3= 21 meals for a lowly price of $85. It even came with a bitchin' jug. If you're doing the math, that's a hair over $4 a meal, and if you get the most economical package, i.e. 4 weeks worth of it, it comes to be less than $3 a meal. WHAT?</p>

<p>It is now July 2015, and I've been eating Soylent consistently for weekday lunch (and sometimes breakfast) since the first plunge into this&nbsp;experiment against humanity,&nbsp;except for a month in the middle, where I was back in the motherland (that's Toronto) for two weeks eating homecooked food that was cooked for me but not by me so I really can't complain, and two weeks in Berkeley where I thought I'd revisit eating campus food everyday - still feels like shit, no matter how tasty. So anyway, countless number of people have written about their powder-fueled journey, there's a whole subReddit dedicated to it and it's ubiquitously the first place people check when their poo&nbsp;comes out to be&nbsp;a different color/texture than expected (more on that later).&nbsp;But&nbsp;I thought I'd just jot down some of my own experiences, for good times' sake, and maybe 500 years later someone will dig up my blog and wonder why the fuck didn't I write about eating actual food because who still does that?</p><p><strong>The Theory</strong><br />In theory, Soylent is the future, it's as simple as that. A bag clocks about 2000 calories, the average intake requirement for an average sized person, as well as the recommended amount of minerals and vitamins and the whole shebang. Now, I'm not a food and&nbsp;nutrition expert, so definitely don't take this as the word of God on whether it is entirely safe to eat Soylent. But like I said, a) two years went by with no incidents and b) there is a whole subreddit for it where people talk about their experience. I did, however, check out the nutrition content, and as far as I can tell, it's all good in the hood. I'm definitely getting more of the obscure minerals from drinking Soylent.&nbsp;Now, I'd feel a bit different if I was eating ONLY Soylent, 3 meals a day, but I'm not. And I am comforted by my hypothesis that whatever Soylent is lacking (or in excess), it's probably not as bad as a Burger King combo or your favorite under-$10 campus lunch, which was what I was willing to eat on a daily basis. You mix the powder with water, shake it up, chill it for a few hours (optional but highly recommended), and voila.</p><p>If it sounds magical, it's because it really is. Again, the conversation with regards to your physical and mental health&nbsp;is probably different if you're only eating Soylent, but for one or two meals a day, the only thing you could ask for is possibly some flavor. Obviously, this removes the hassle of packing a lunch everyday, or spending extra money to eat unhealthy food at school. But&nbsp;the thing that really keeps me coming back is how good I feel after consuming it. People were wondering whether you get full: yes, you get full. But you don't get bloated, and you don't get the post-lunch itis/lull that you'd normally get. It's as if someone magically cured you of your hunger. Maybe it's not so much the magic of Soylent, but an indication that I was eating way too much for lunch. This is definitely a possibility, as I get hungry faster now, but the good thing is that I can just bring a bigger jug of it and drink half for my AM lunch and half for my PM lunch.</p><p><strong>The Reality</strong><br />The reality is pretty much in line with the theory, with some practical caveats. First of all, it doesn't taste great. It doesn't taste BAD, but it's not good either. It's like, I don't know, the most average taste you can imagine, which is surprisingly close to unsalted porridge, or if you're Asian like me, freshly ground soy milk. If fact, the color is about as average as you can find, too, kind of like a oatmeal smoothie mixed with soy milk. What do you know, that's also the description for its&nbsp;texture. Now I'm starting to think it's just ground up oatmeal with soy milk.</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1853.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/55b9c675e4b010ed13407119/1438238451408//img.jpg" alt="I gotta know what a $5 dollar shake tastes like."/> I gotta know what a $5 dollar shake tastes like.[/caption]


<p>It appears that some people rather like the taste, and even become fond of it. For those of us that don't, there is a wide range of condiments one could add to it. A friend of mine suggested Hershey (or Nesquik) chocolate syrup, as well as peanut butter powder. I tried Nestle vanilla Coffee Mate the other day, that was REALLY good, for about a quarter of the cup, then it tasted&nbsp;like I'm eating vanilla extract. The point is, I don't think the flavor is going to be the deal breaker for anyone, especially if you have normal food in your life.</p><p>While I'm on the topic, I'm just gonna lay it out right here. Guys, I eat regular food still. Everyday. Breakfast and dinner, and all three meals on the weekend. Also, JUST BECAUSE I'm drinking goo on the daily, doesn't mean I don't have culinary standards still. I'm just breaking up the meal into its functional components: there is the part where I have to feed myself and keep myself alive, but there is also the part where I like to eat yummy things, and also cheap things. Sometimes one overrides the other, which is when I go out for a nice dirty fastfood burger. It's like, just because you have a pair of really comfortable sneakers that you'd rather wear everywhere, you still need dress shoes every now and then or you'll look like a fool. Soylent is my pair of golden dress shoes. Actually, it's probably the other way around.</p><p>Also, it's worth noting the reaction I get from people when I first tell them that I'm on a partial Soylent diet (and describe what it is for folks that don't know). They largely come in three varieties:<br />1) "Where do I sign up? This is like the greatest thing ever, where do I sign up?"<br />2) "Why do you hate yourself? Do you like taking out the fun in everything? Did you have a traumatic childhood or something?"<br />3) "Haha you're eating people."</p><p><strong>The Ugly</strong><br />Okay, here comes the most important bit of information if you're looking to try Soylent. If you can't handle graphic descriptions, just skip the next&nbsp;two paragraphs entirely, but I highly recommend reading it if you're considering taking the plunge:&nbsp;YES, you get gassy, and &nbsp;your shit is going to be really weird.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's talk about the gas first. For those of you that know me, I'm a pretty regular guy, and I'd say I'm pretty polite too. For those of you that&nbsp;know me better, I'm gassy as hell. I don't know what it is, my hypothesis is that I eat too fast and swallow too much air, because my farts are usually not smelly at all unless I ate some kind of ethnic food or another, but they ARE usually very loud. Okay that's regular Richard. Soylent Richard is a different beast. I hate to use the same old cliche, but it becomes silent and deadly. The first night after drinking Soylent, I almost killed myself in bed, and I dreamt that I was being gassed to death. This is 100% true story. Also, you will experience stomach grumbling and bloating. Not much, but noticeable. Like, if you were writing an afternoon exam, your neighbor would be slightly concerned (rightfully so because he's about to be gassed to death).</p><p>That's the bark, now let's talk about the bite. Think about it like this: your poo is usually solid, that means something solid should have contributed to the structure. Now you replace said solid with a thick liquid with no discernible formation, what would you expect to happen? Well, one of two things, and to everyone's relief, it's not diarrhea, there isn't enough liquid for that to happen, at least not for me. What does happen is that it becomes more difficult to poop, and they come out pretty much like clumps of what went in, that's as much as I'm willing to describe. If you want more gory details, check out the subreddit, or the Soylent community page. I definitely learned something new perusing the forums, like what a Bristol stool scale is.&nbsp;In any case, it's not pleasant, but it's not life-threatening or anything. Again, this was all personal experience, as some people seem to be perfectly fine with it. I think my colons are too straight or something, so two meals don't really have a chance to meet up and say hello, and what is solid remains solid and what is Soylent remains Soylent.</p><p>If the backend problems have alerted you, fear not, as I have stumbled upon the perfect antidote: celery. I bought a bag of celery last week as a healthy snack after binge eating campus food in Berkeley, to my pleasant surprise, it completely fixed everything: the bloat, the gas, and the poop. I honestly wouldn't even know that I was drinking Soylent for lunch just judging by the lack of partying in my stomach and how sturdy my....okay. In hindsight, that should have been the first thing I tried, since celery is literally water and fibre. So now, instead of goo, I have fibre-weaved goo for lunch. Amazing. So if you're experiencing gastrointestinal problems while consuming Soylent, you're not alone, and celery is literally your best friend. I imagine though any fibrous fruits or veggies will do just fine.</p><p><strong>The Verdict</strong><br />Well, if you are too lazy to make lunch everyday, too sane&nbsp;to eat shit lunch everyday, or are too poor to purchase "healthy" lunches everyday, Soylent is for you. For me, I usually make a big batch of food for the week's dinner so that's not a problem, and breakfast is a simple oatmeal and egg and toast or something, though it's really convenient to be able to wake up late and still get a full breakfast on the go: just grab a bottle. Obviously I'm not sponsored by them or anything, or I wouldn't have told you to gas and poo problems. It's just a great product that I can stomach and feel somewhat healthy about my life choices...until somebody dies, that is.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Redesigning the TP</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Toilet paper is not made optimally.</p><p>When you wipe your butt, only that one square that makes direct contact has to be soft on the surface, the rest is just padding that gets folded in. Furthermore, only one side of that square has to be soft, nobody (I hope) uses the flip side of the same square again.&nbsp;In that sense, assuming everyone folds into the same side (like, half then half again,&nbsp;as opposed to an 'S' fold), a whole roll of toilet paper only has to be soft on one side, like how tape is only sticky on one side.&nbsp;</p><p>Engineering could be a&nbsp;problem. I can only assume that it's easier to make toilet paper the way you make regular paper, i.e. from mashed pulp, compared to making a sheet then applying something on one side of it. But if you only coat one side, it's possible to dramatically reduce the thickness of the soft part of toilet paper, and make the other side out of those hard brown towel or even bristolboard for extra structural support. In other words, we NEED to decouple the two functional components of toilet paper -&nbsp;soft contact and rigid support - such that prioritizing for one does not come at the cost of the other.</p><p>It's a whole nother story if you're a crumpler though. Maybe the fact that toilet paper is not designed this way is direct evidence that it's meant to be used as crumplers do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Getting Back On the Horse</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/3/31/getting-back-on-the-horse</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If there was an award for how hard someone fell off the horse, my 4-month hiatus from writing would probably place podium. Although, I think we can all agree that it's better late -&nbsp;very, very, very late - than never, which reminds me: somewhere floating in the interwebs is my Wordpress blog from 4th year. In any case, I am getting back on this horse.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly, I wasn't that busy. If I couldn't spare an hour a week to write about something, ANYTHING, then I'm probably doing grad school wrong. But then again, I don't work in a wet lab. Actually, through these 4 months, I was painfully aware of my reasons for not wanting to write, and there were really only two. First, I fucked with the design one time a few months ago and never got around to fixing/improving it, and so every time I felt like writing something, which I do pretty often, I first had to fix the website. Yes, SquareSpace is amazing and has all the bells and whistles I could wish for, but if I can't figure out the CSS to make my color palette exactly the way I wanted, then by God I will not type a single letter more. It's like, would you cook up the most amazing dinner service, only to have it served on a plate with JUST a slight hint of uncleaned grease? I don't think so. It became such a disease that I thought to myself, why the hell didn't I just stick with Wordpress in the first place? It's free, easy, and I'm not responsible for any of the design aspects, not if I didn't want to be, anyway. Did I mention it was free?&nbsp;Such is the paradox of freedom. Fortunately, I buckled down and fixed whatever I had to fix, which probably made no difference to anybody but me, and replaced those stupid letter images for the links on the homepage. It took as long as I thought it would, which was quite long, so at least I got the accurate estimation of the situation thing going on for me. Now that it's fine, I feel like it's my baby again, by which I mean the most beautiful baby in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The second reason was much more bothersome, though, which I guess is a good thing when you're looking for excuses to not write. It's the problem of "who the hell cares?" It's the equivalent of an existential crisis for my blog, channeled through me.&nbsp;At the lowest level, blogging is my form of self-expression, and sometimes I want to express, but most of the times I don't, not to the internets anyway. Outward expression is not really my thing, I'd much rather express in my own head and be satisfied with not having said anything, which unsurprisingly applies to my day to day interactions with people. If there was ever a time to use "it's not you, it's me", now is that time. It's not just this website, it's my Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, everything. My Twitter feed is so sad that I'm starting to enjoy tweeting random things regularly because it's like shouting into a canyon and hearing back your own crazy voice.&nbsp;Also, I pegged this blog as somewhat of a professional one <span>(by professional I really mean "content&nbsp;of quality" and "not rambles")</span>, especially since it's linked to every one of the aforementioned social media platforms that I had&nbsp;the unfortunate inclination of signing up for. I still stand by that, because why the fuck would I pay for a domain name and design a pretty landing page if I wasn't going to link my real name to it? But the problem - yet another problem - is that I have no professional content to write about, at least not at the same rate as I have <strong>un</strong>professional content. This is hilarious because, as I am nearing the tender age of 24, I have lived enough of my life to realize some of my own tendencies, and one of them is that I would peg EVERY blog I owned as a professional blog (yes, even my tumblr, and my facebook notes when I really tried), and I would NEVER have enough professional content to write about, not at the rate I wanted to anyway.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All this begs the question, why am I still doing this and how am I going to continue? Well, I'm doing this because I'm paying for this website and I already set my baby up so why not. Plus, I have realized that I do enjoy materializing some of my very convoluted thoughts, it makes me laugh. It makes me laugh when I write it, and again when I read it a couple of months later, sometimes I laugh at how funny I thought I was being but wasn't actually. Also, not to suddenly get too deep here, but&nbsp;I do believe that our impact in this world is substantiated through action. If I can't take my money when I die, I sure as hell can't take any of my thoughts. Wait, I screwed that one up: I'm taking ALL of my thoughts with me, and nobody's getting none of it, so better to be generous now. This is a really hand-wavy resolution to my need for validation, and&nbsp;I am not happy with it, but refer to the next paragraph.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As to how, well, one hope is that as I move further along my research, I will be able to write about a cool paper or two that I've read. In fact, I've read about 50 cool papers last term and could have written up any of them, but that was when the design was messed up right? Also, I'm HOPING I'll have some of my own research to write up at some point, maybe some early results or something, as long as it doesn't conflict with potential&nbsp;future work or submissions. I'm lucky to have an advisor that's very supportive of the open science movement, even if my own stupid inclination is to keep things secret, which is a whole 'nother can of worms. Fundamentally, though, I think I need to change my perspective on what's professional/of-quality and what's not. I thought the San Antonion Spurs write-up was pretty of-quality, except that only took about 3 months to write in a summer where I had absolutely nothing else to do. Obviously, part of it is my fear of throwing out unpolished content, because it would be disappointing and also make me look stupid. But sometimes it's also a lack of self-satisfaction if I don't get to the absolute bottom of it all.&nbsp;I guess I will slowly have to come to grip with the fact that, actually, nobody gives a shit. I mean, I'm not writing for the New York Times over here, so why do I keep thinking that I am? I'm hesitant to make another pledge after the spectacular failure that is my pledge to write once a week, so I semi-pledge that these will get written in one sitting, especially on a stream-of-consciousness one like this, in an effort to deliberately put out half-assed content to overcome my fear of half-ass-ery. Is "Perfect is the enemy of good" too cliche of a tattoo?&nbsp;</p><p>I can't end this without a reference to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVkUvmDQ3HY&amp;spfreload=10">this</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Don't Worry, Be Being Happy</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/11/30/dont-worry-be-being-happy</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I've had the (un)fortunate opportunity to learn about&nbsp;many somewhat-outdated&nbsp;cognitive models over the past two months of my education in Cognitive Science, one of them being Conceptual Metaphor Theory. I will spare you the gory details of the theory itself, partly because I didn't torture myself into reading about all the gory details. Google it if you're interested (or read Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980)&nbsp;.&nbsp;The gist of it is this: <strong>our everyday language is embedded with "conceptual metaphors"&nbsp;that link&nbsp;an often abstract concept to a sensorimotor experience or a spatial concept.</strong> For example, "my future is on the rise" (not sure if I just made that up. doesn't sound very right) has no literal meaning, but we understand "up" to mean "good", so "on the rise" implies "getting better". Another good one is "I love you more". The concept of "more is good" is so ingrained in our everyday speech that we somehow acquired the ability to measure "love" while bypassing defining what love actually is. There is&nbsp;an infinite number of these, and while I still think any model of cognition or "concepts" that doesn't mention brain or neurons is stupid, it's quite fun as a game -&nbsp;see how many conceptual metaphors you can spot.&nbsp;So, on my rampage to catch myself from using conceptual metaphors, I noticed a very interesting word that we use everyday, and the reason I'm writing about this today has nothing to do with cognition, but more so with improving your mental health.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; One of these is not like the rest: the car is fast, the tree is green, he is tall, the squirrels are fat, I am sad.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Did you spot it?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What I realized is that the word "is" (are/am/be) has two very distinctive meanings. The first, as in the first 4 examples, means the presence of a state or attribute, that we're describing something as we perceive it. But what's so different about the last example? Yes, it is&nbsp;about "me", and that's where this strange usage difference often occurs: "is" is often used to imply agency, as in&nbsp;something has the ability to do something, and is currently doing that thing. This second meaning is used when we perceive something as having a mind, so we theorize about their intention for something, or in our own case, stating our intention. So, although not strictly accurate, we can simplify these two description to "passive being" and "active being", in order to avoid me further confusing you. In other words, when we say "is", sometimes we mean "is", but sometimes we mean "is being." It is obviously affected by the word that comes after "is", i.e.&nbsp;whether that word necessitates having a subject or object. Verbs are usually pretty easy to tell, but adjectives are a lot more ambiguous. For example, "he is upset" can go both ways: he is upset as a state of being, or he is actively being upset at something, and that's the point&nbsp;I wanted to raise today.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You must be thinking to yourselves at this point, "is he f-ing serious?" The answer is yes, meaning I am being serious, not that I am a serious person. Aside from our remarkable ability to distinguish between these situations on the fly, we often misuse the two meanings with intention. For example, "my microwave is crazy" implies an agent that's plotting to overheat all your food, because the word crazy doesn't make sense if it's used with a passive, non-agent. We might know it in the literary world as personification, but I feel like it's a bit more important than any old literary device. But while that is very interesting, the point of this article is to emphasize what we often do conversely, that is, using passive "is" to describe an agent, and often detrimentally, ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I really feel like I'm getting nowhere after 3 paragraphs trying to build a coherent lead-up, so I'll just lay it out: we have a choice to be happy or sad, but we often feel passive through our emotions and sometimes helpless, because, as I argue, we are confusing the word "is" between its&nbsp;two usages. Because we use "is" to describe the existence of a property so much, sometimes we mistakenly think something is an attribute just because we use "is" to describe it.&nbsp;As an agent with what I perceive to be choice, every time I am sad, it's because I am being sad, not because sadness is an attribute of me. But the way we use "is" to say "the cup is blue" is spilling over into the way we describe ourselves. So does that mean agency implies that it has a choice over all matters, and that we should say "I am being ____" instead of "I am ____" in all circumstances? No. I am 5ft11,&nbsp;I am not being 5ft11. I guess the point is this: unlike your height, you have some choice over your emotions and state of mind, and that is a good thing. Being happy is not as passive as waiting for something to make you happy, it's as simple as be being happy.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm not saying I've found the cure to all emotional ailments like depression, no way José. And it is still very likely that none of us are active agents, and my consciousness is just a by-product of my biophysically constrained meat shell, so "is" actually only means passively having an attribute. But what I AM saying is simply this (conditioned on your belief of your own existence): instead of saying "I am sad", sometimes it feels better to say "I am being sad", as stupid as that might sound.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The importance of language in reasoning</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/15/the-importance-of-language-in-reasoning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; In the study of cognitive science, we would like to think that humans employ a fairly formal system of reasoning, meaning that computations in the mind are somehow form-invariant, that words are not minced, and that we take what was said exactly as it was said – at least that’s what we used to think. Language is such a fundamental basis of cognition that it is often overlooked, where it’s become an implicit assumption that people rarely question. However, it is due to exactly the subtle and pervasive nature of language that we stumble in the formalization of human cognition, because not only is language often an uncontrollable variable in the black box of the human mind, it also has profound impacts on the way we investigate cognition. A distinction should be made here between our spoken language and “language” in general, because mathematical symbols, for example, are also used as a language, a more precise one at that, but not without its own problems. This essay will first look at some of the issues we face with the spoken language, and hopefully then generalize to the broader sense of the word.</span></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Language is the basis of a standardized communication, moreover, it is the form that we use to construct internal thoughts: such is the importance of language in reasoning – it is the vehicle for communication. This should be intuitive if not obvious, so I will continue by talking about the problems we face in cognitive science when its importance is ignored. Without language, we can’t reason with each other, and we will probably do a bad job reasoning with ourselves. Reasoning is by definition a deductive process, i.e. “if A then B”, which is a systematic reduction of possibilities in pursuit of a relationship between cause and effect. Therefore, reasoning requires precise symbols and syntax, such that no new information is introduced by the ambiguities of their application. This is exactly where the spoken language creates problems in our study of cognition – not so much that the expectation of precision is not met, but that the gap between expectation and reality is often overlooked, and thus, unaccounted for.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Grice’s maxims of cooperative communication, as they are introduced in Kahneman &amp; Tversky, nicely model our expectations in the usage of language, such as the maxim of quantity whereby the listener infers hidden meaning from the message, assuming that the speaker would not say things that the listener can infer. The details of the maxims, revelatory as they are, are not extremely important. The key takeaway is that listeners routinely make inferences from what is explicitly said, which essentially breaks down the requirement of precision in the symbols and syntax of a step in logical deduction. It is actually quite amazing that we are able to use the spoken language to reason at all, but of course, a different set of expectations may be used in strictly deductive conversations, such as in academic discourses. Curiously, the inference of hidden meaning from an explicit message is itself a form of reasoning, where we use contextual information to make logical conclusions about the intended message. This is a sort of meta-reasoning – reasoning about the vehicle of reasoning itself. In this instance, it is possible that we’re not using language in our internal reasoning, being able to quickly bypass explicit formulations of the object in question and instead preferring to use a fuzzier integrator. Nonetheless, it creates problems in our investigation of cognitive processes, as it was raised in both Tversky and Gigerenzer, since the explicit inputs and outputs do not necessarily reflect the internal processes.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As imprecise as the spoken language is, could we expect to do better with a more precise system of communication, such as mathematical symbols? Yes, we can, but not always. Mathematical symbols themselves have almost zero ambiguity in the message it’s trying to convey – a ‘+’ is always a sum of two things. Actually, I shouldn’t say zero ambiguity, as a good point was raised in Tversky that there is still contextual information, and that base-2 operations is completely different from base-10 operations. However, with mathematical and other formal systems, it’s much easier to pinpoint the implicit contextual information, often represented by the axioms of the system itself. An interesting result of all three readings is that when you take two representations of the exact same mathematical message, and translate it to the spoken language, our ability to reason heavily depends on which representation is seen: the presented argument between probabilists and frequentists. It would seem extraordinary that two equivalent representations could produce such dissimilar results, it’s like saying a calculator suddenly doesn’t know how to calculate angles when it goes from degrees to radians. Upon further investigation, though, this result shouldn’t be so surprising. In a strictly mathematical system, 1/2, 50/100, and 0.5 all mean literally the exact same thing, because the contextual information (axiom) states that the numerator and denominator should be ignored, and they are merely representations of the same final result: 50%. When this message is taken into the world of the spoken language, however, the explicit rule is lost. Or rather, it’s drowning in the sea of contextual information humans deem to be more important based on the specific situation, such as the chance that a hunt will be successful. As the example raised in the reading, we can be a lot more confident when we catch dinner 50 out of 100 times, as opposed to 1 out of 2 times.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As I near the end of my essay, I’ve undergone a minor shift in stance. Although language is still very important in our ability to reason and in communicating our reasoning, it is not the only component that enables reasoning, as we are very apt at reasoning implicitly using the contextual information available to us. In addition to our inability to control specific interpretations of language, we’re often unaware of an entirely different system that was used to reason. Perhaps this is the same reason for what now seems to be badly-contrived experiment designs in the past: we wrongly assume that language is the only vehicle of reasoning, hence if we interpret the language used in a “think-aloud” experiment intelligently, even given the ambiguities of interpretation, we should still be able to make reasonable conclusions about the cognitive processes in play. However, the truth may be that we employ other vehicles of reasoning that simply are not reflected in the explicit and conscious formulation of Language (big L, including math and the likes). This also changes the definition of reasoning. Historically, we think of reasoning as a higher order function that necessarily recruits a conscious thought process. After all, Aristotle claimed that reasoning is the pinnacle of human intelligence. In reality, much of our reasoning, especially in the context of everyday life, occurs subconsciously, far removed from explicit representations through language. In this sense, there’s no reason to think that animals do not reason, as every animal is able to make conclusions based on previous and contextual evidence. It is with the realization of having committed the mortal sin of anthropocentricity that I shamefully conclude my essay.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Is human reasoning rational?</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/8/is-human-reasoning-rational</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shamelessly plugging course work into the blog. Why not, right? Since I have to write once a week, might as well get my blog back up to healthy numbers.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To tackle the problem of rationality, we must first define explicitly what being rational means. It seems that, through the readings, rationality is taken to be equivalent as deductive logic, which is then studied in laboratory settings and results in surprising performance incongruences. I will address the irrationality of that in the latter half of this essay, but first, I want to share some anecdotal experiences of my encounter with rationality.</p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to college for engineering, and lived with 3 of my best friends who were all mathematically-inclined and extremely logical people- in other words, the most rational people I knew. We’d have debates on a regular basis, during which we try to subdue each other’s argument by finding logical inconsistencies. But these arguments were not entirely scholarly in nature, as they are often a true reflection of our opinions, which meant that the defeat of one’s argument was equivalent to denouncing one’s rationality, and that was a cardinal sin in the undergraduate engineering population. To give an example, one argument went like this: since we’re all studying to become engineers, and that we want to contribute to society, then we should do everything we can to tilt the balance towards positive progress. If this is the case, then it is only rational that when the time comes to have children, we should instead adopt children from less fortunate circumstances and raise them as our own, which will simultaneously improve the quality of a person’s life by removing them from all kinds of risk factors associated with orphanages, as well as remove a burden from the social welfare system. After flailing about in trying to find a rational counter to this argument backed by any sort of empirical data- stretching from evolution reasons of passing down one’s genes, to the chemical pheromones of one’s own offspring facilitating bonding- in the end, I gave up my own rationality, because I just want my own kid and I don’t quite know why. This was not the only argument to end this way, as it wasn’t a question of IF we’re proven to be irrational, but a question of when and after how many “why”s.</p><p style="text-align:justify">From these exchanges, I concluded that human behaviour is actually very rational, or at least we have the capacity to act rationally. The problem was that at the very bottom level, there are always axioms that cannot be further produced through logical deductions. In fact, this is true of any formal system: a logical deduction must have a point of origin, which serves to be the axioms of the system and are taken unquestioned. And as Kurt Godel has pointed out, no meaningful formal system can be complete and consistent, which boils down to that some things cannot be proven and will have to be taken for granted. Of course, some axioms are useful, and ideally they’re consistent, but they don’t have to be, especially in humans. So really, being rational just means that we are able to go from axiom to theorem, and one theorem to the next, while consistently following a set of syntactical rules. I don’t claim to understand these human axioms or their origins, nor am I a proponent of Freudian theories that some things are just the way they are, like wishing to sleep with one’s mother. But I do believe that there is a clear parallel between the human mind and formal systems. A big caveat, though, is that formal systems exclude the possibility of learning anything new, and if humans strictly operated using deductive (or rational) reasoning, then we will not be able to survive, even as individuals. It could be that humans are rational within our scope of knowledge, but outside of it, we need to be able to act irrationally – inconsistently – in order to learn new behavioural rules to survive.</p><p style="text-align:justify">Having set up my position, I want to address some of the points raised in the readings. On the surface, it feels like the 3 pieces seem to progressively increase in their reasonableness, as a function of time. Newell and Simon’s general problem solver is an archaic and ridiculous model of human cognition, as it “replicated” a very narrow set of behaviors and called it mission accomplished, not to mention its assumption of logical operations in the human mind to start with. Oaksford and Chater, on the other hand, summarized the more agreeable, Baysian models of thought and decision making. But if we take a step back, it should be apparent at the time of each of the three articles, the proposed model for human thought was nowhere near to be the complete blueprint for cognition, but it was simply claimed to be a worthwhile model because that was the state of the art in our advancement of inference algorithms. In other words, these models weren’t cognition-inspired, but we decided to fit our conception of the mind to these models because that’s the best we could do at the time - in the 60s, it was deductive logic, and in the 90s, it was Bayesian inference. Knowing that, perhaps we should be reminded of our humility the next time we claim to have a model of the human mind.</p><p style="text-align:justify">My biggest issues with modeling human rationality, though, are in the following two problems. The first being the scientific methods employed in testing rationality so far, or rather, what we deem to be rational in a laboratory setting. Given that this is a scientific enterprise, I understand that we must tightly control parameters in order to extract meaningful interpretations from experiments. Although, having indeed controlled for the parameters, we must then present conclusions with qualifiers for the experimental settings, and not paint with broad strokes on human rationality. This was touched on in Oaksford &amp; Chater, though I’d like to draw emphasis to it. Plopping a subject down in a room and presenting a deduction type puzzle certainly provides insight on one’s ability to operate within a well-defined system. However, it should not come as a surprise to both the logic and the models people that the subject comes from an outside system, having practiced rationality using a separate set of rules for some 20 years (for your average undergraduate participant anyway). It may be true that the performance in the Wason task significantly improves when a real life scenario is used instead of its original wording, but that should be expected as well, because if you present a calculus problem, people do much better when they can utilize their intuition and experience on velocity, rather than the “derivative of distance”. So in the end, are people’s failures on the Wason task an indication of irrationality, or an inability to translate between parallel situations?</p><p style="text-align:justify">My second problem comes from the disregard for the level of abstraction from the mind to the model, and thus what meaningful conclusions we can and cannot draw from it. In this particular aspect, I agree with John Searle, which is that a model of something is not the thing itself. The deductive GPS mimics the behavioral process a human uses when solving a logic puzzle, then humans must be deductive! Or even now, because Bayesian models can predict human behavior, we must (implicitly) think in Bayesian terms! Then, if we build a robot that can intake food and lie down for 7 hours at night, would we call it human as well? I am aware that no one claimed that the GPS IS a human, but I do believe that we should make these kinds of general comments with extreme caution. This, then, begs the question of can we ever create something that thinks, as no matter how close the abstraction is to the real deal, there is always a gap, even if the model consists of physiologically accurate neuronal processes. To that, I offer the point that no two human minds are even alike, so if the closest thing to a human mind isn’t even really like that particular human mind, how close do we hope to approximate using a machine? But, depending on how much detail we want to smear away, we CAN make (often useful) abstractions and lump certain human faculty together, such as deductive reasoning and probabilistic inference, we just have to be conscious of that fact.</p><p style="text-align:justify">In closing, I found it amusing that while Newel/Simon and Laird attempt to argue that the mind is a symbol manipulating machine, Searle argues that the machine cannot be the mind – and I disagreed with both accounts. I think this really boils down to personal philosophy, and mine is that no matter how close a machine gets, it can never BE human. But it can approximate human thoughts very accurately, depending on the level of abstraction, though it will have to be years removed from the ones in the readings to be considered even close to human. It is, in a way, asymptotic, but since each individual human mind can only be asymptotically similar to another, once a machine gets within range, we may not be able to tell the difference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Creative Serendipity: Death by Googling</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/27/creativity-and-answers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This topic has been written to near-death, given how many different articles I've read regarding the adverse effects of the information age. Alas, as I've yet again procrastinated away a full writing week, and considering how I've been beating myself up over over-Googling for a little while now, I feel that this is an appropriate time to at least jot down my own insights and experiences.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I love Google. I can't imagine anyone getting remotely close to finishing a Bachelor's degree (or anything in life, really) without Google. But then again, most people did/do. And when I say Google, I really mean the internet and its vast storage of information that is accessible one query away. The standard argument I've read from proponents usually point to the needlessness for humans to remember facts and constants, hence the existence of engineer's manuals and constants tables. Of course, I agree with this. And just to qualify, I'm not an opponent of the internet or Google. Google's mission statement is to make information easily accessible for everyone in the world, and they're doing a damn good job. They are also in no way responsible for how this information is accessed, perhaps aside from the requirement that it should be easy. And it is exactly this extreme ease of information access that results in the linear, answer-oriented discoveries, and slowly spells the end of process-oriented and serendipitous discoveries.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Through my experience in being mindful of how I learn, I often find myself asking, "damn, how did the first person to ever do XYZ come up with this method?"- and the answer is usually simple: trial and error through disciplined process. Almost rarely do we hear of great discoveries that was the result of an experiment or procedure that panned out exactly the way it was intended, and rightfully so, as if it was so straightforward that somebody got it right on the first try, then it wouldn't have been such a big deal. However, being the selfless yet glory-seeking species that we are, the result is often reported with the successful procedures to help ease the process for the next person, but with no mention of failures. I'm thinking of things like baking a cake, fixing your car, deriving an equation, but in more serious circumstances, propagation of scientific knowledge. As such, the "right way" becomes valuable information in the microcosm of the originator: to himself, but also to the members of his immediate community, who now benefit from his diligent experimentation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, someone in a remote community stumbles upon the same problem, but to no avail. She will then proceed to experiment, perhaps in similar, but never identical, fashion, as to our first discoverer. And let's say she succeeds in conquering the problem as well, she will have spent a much longer time to arrive at a marginally different answer than would be required if she were to simply follow the "correct" procedures. But, she will have gained the expertise, as well as the keys to the problem with a completely different perspective, due to the fact that she's a different human being in a different community, but also because she did a different set of wrong things. Can you imagine if every one of us had to repeat this process for every little thing in life? Most of us follow recipes when we bake cupcakes, which is fine, but I believe this is also the reason why grandma's cupcakes are always better, and that not everyone who can bake a great cupcake is a baker. <strong>In essence, mastery of a craft is not characterized by one's ability to do it right, but by the knowledge of every which way it can go wrong and their subsequent events.</strong> Children are awesome at this, because they have no fear of doing it wrong, but more importantly, they don't have a notion of doing it "right"- they just play. It is only through growing up do we become aware of mistakes and consequences, valuing the right way and punishing the wrong way. And so few of us at this age have the courage to consistently do it wrong, because we know time is valuable but even more valuable is our reputation and self-image.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What does all this have to do with Google and the internet? Well, since it gives us unprecedented ability to share information, and given our propensity to only share the "right way", we've become more homogeneous than ever with regards to a particular challenge, minimizing divergent efforts in the wrong directions in order to optimize for successes. The problem is, innovation occurs much more organically through divergent thinking- how can you innovate when you already know what the "right" answer is? Worse yet, Google instills a feeling of safety in us that, not only can we find the right answer, but that an answer exists. This simple fact exponentially (disclaimer: hyperbole) decreases the value of process: "why does it matter what road we take if it will just lead to the same thing?" Obviously, the process is not the means to an end, but that the means IS the end, at least for when we try to learn something. I believe we remember processes and contexts much more easily than we remember individual results, and I say I believe not because I dreamed it up (although it is definitely true through personal experience), but because it's 1:30AM and I don't have the effort to find the neuroscience papers I know I've read. Lastly, and this is what I dislike the most, knowing that the answer is one strategically-worded query away decreases the effort I'm willing to spend to find my answer, and it almost completely takes away my ability to form a plan for execution. I'm not sure if this is a reported phenomenon, but I find that effort scales up with perceived difficulty (until it becomes so hard that you're falling off the other end of the rollercoaster screaming "fuck that"). So if it takes me a journey to Mordor for my answer, I might walk all the way on a good day, but only halfway on an off day. Same kind of scaling happens when the maximum effort required is to type an incoherent sentence, too. What does that mean? Well, it means I don't value my knowledge that much, and that I spend my queries lavishly. But when I'm stumped because Google's drawing blanks, I literally don't know another way to find my answer, so I just stop trying, because I hadn't planned or thought about it enough to type anything in Google other than my original search query reworded 17 times.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All the above problems made me seriously consider a Google-free diet. Aside from its extreme masochism and infeasibility, though, it's not just Google: it's Quora, it's Wikipedia, it's eHow, it's StackExchange (thank god for SE). So what I've pledged to do is to use these services more intelligently and more responsibly. Specifically, to form a hypothesis and a plan before diving head-first into Google. I'd like to think that 4 years at UofT haven't taught me shit, but the truth is that I've learned a lot of fundamental knowledge, as well as problem solving skills, to derive the answer to most problems in life, like, for example, how to connect car battery jumper cables. Maybe I'm trying to hard to fight it; maybe, 10 years from now, the most attractive skill set stops being problem-solving, but rather, how to find the answer on Google.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm just going to end today's segment with this: we often applaud the innovators of every generation for their massive creativity/intellect/ingenuity, but what we should really be admiring is their courage to do the wrong thing.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I should have named this piece "Larry Page probably doesn't use Google."</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Danger of Rationality</title>
      <link>/blog/dangerofrationality</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me open with an anecdote: last night I bought a rain jacket from SportsChek, it was on sale 30% off for $100 and it's a relatively good brand (as I was told by one extremely fashionable Western U girl). But the biggest thing that did it for me was really the color scheme, which for some reason I fell in love with at first sight. Having made the purchase, I informed the parental units that I've bought my jacket this morning over breakfast, since they knew I've been looking for one for a while. Upon demonstration, the objections came in the following order:</p><p>1) "it's too small"<br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "</em><em>but the sleeves are perfect length!"</em>;<br />2) "there won't be enough room to fit a sweater under"<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;*<em>proceed to wear a hoodie underneath*;&nbsp;</em><br />3) "the color scheme makes you look bottom-heavy/immature/etc"<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"okay...."</em>;<br />4) "the design is made for white folks with longer arms, you obviously have to get a different brand"<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>"......"</em><br />5) "you just really love it now, wait till you become more rational after a few days"</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Pause. This simple, and honestly, quite standard exchange just enlightened me, for the hundredth time, upon the reason for over 80% of the pointless arguments I have, and I've formulated it, as titled, the danger of rationality.</p><p class="text-align-center">_____</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rationality exists within a particular system, a system with values and mechanisms to achieve said values. From outside the scope of the system, rational behaviors are really better described as consistent than logical. However, it seems that this fact is obscure to all but the most rigorous of mathematicians, those who do not preach "1+1=2", but that "1+1=2 is an assumption". Those that set up the boundaries of the system are most aware of the internal versus external,&nbsp;<em>the rational as the consistent</em>. Those of us who have lived our entire lives within one system, however, struggle to make sense of the possibility that another set of different&nbsp;behaviors can be equally "rational". This, in essence, is the beauty and danger of rational thinking: I am justified in rejecting your views, not because my views are consistent for me in my system, but that my views are consistent for everyone, with the implicit and forgotten assumption that we are within one system and therefore, rational for everyone. Let me stress that, this is not just "I like X because I just do", but "I like X because of logic, and how can we question logic?" How convenient and secure.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Raised in a rational household and excelled in logical subjects, my whole life until now has been devoted to rationality: math, physics, engineering. Slowly, and I don't know when it happened, the rational thought process became my safe haven, and shortly after that, my only mode of engagement with the external world. I embraced what I could reason through and denounced what was arbitrary. I accepted your superiority if you could logically convince me of your views, while I secretly pronounced you stupid if you didn't follow my line of reasoning: boundary, value, mechanism- the whole package. When I arrived for Engineering Science at UofT, I thought I would bask in the glory of certainty, objectivity,&nbsp;<strong>rationality,&nbsp;</strong>both in my studies and in the people around me. Never will I have a stupid argument again, because we can work things out as, wait for it,&nbsp;<em>human beings</em>. It's almost comical now that I look back, when I sought out my first summer research project, which was titled: <strong>classification of emotions through psychophysiological markers</strong>. In other words, rationalizing what's systematically arbitrary with mechanisms I understand in the only system I've ever known. Later, &nbsp;I met some of my best friends, who just happen to share my righteous obsession of rationality. Ironically, it is exactly through my very real and sometimes difficult interactions with them, and of course, with my better half, that I've slowly been able to understand the boundaries of my own system. After all, when a group of extremely logical people argue for hours on end with no resolution, with perfectly justifiable facts, mind you, the only&nbsp;<em>logical</em>&nbsp;conclusion is that there are fundamental differences in the systems we reside in.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me finish here before I end up telling my whole life story. My point is not to prescribe a life with no rationality- that would indeed be stupid. As any advice in life, it is only valuable given the context that came before it, and in this case, let this be the advice I give a 16-year-old, rational, me: rationality is a tool to express yourself, to organize yourself, and to improve yourself. It is not a boulder behind which to hide yourself and your choices, and it is certainly not justifiable grounds for rejecting "irrational" opinions. Engage people around you as who you are, not the system you operate in, and more importantly, do the same for them. Now let me give the same advice to my 23-year-old self, because god knows I'll need it. Oh yeah, did I mention that my newest obsession is now a mechanistic understanding of human cognition and consciousness?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I think I'll keep the jacket.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Cause and Effect</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/5/17/cause-and-effect</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Correlation neither is nor implies causation- it's simply more useful.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Something that's been bothering me for a while is this notion of cause and effect. On the one hand, it seems painfully obvious that causal relationships exist, e.g. the letters do not appear on the screen if I do not hit the keys. But on the other hand, how does one observe causality? What are the necessary conditions behind one event causing another?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We might say that one necessary prerequisite is that the cause precedes the effect, or, more rigorously stated, anything that can be a cause must be in the light cone of the effect. In other words, the cause must be sufficiently before the effect in order for it to be deemed causal, and the time period is determined by the spacetime coordinates of the events and, of course, the speed of light.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surely, this is not unreasonable to ask for, at least from the perspective of physics, but what next? Is everything in the past a cause of an effect in the future? Intuition says no, the caveat being that some causes may not be very obvious, with the "butterfly effect" becoming something of a cliche. Then we might move onto a stricter criterion, let's say, the effect cannot occur without the cause. A brief review of logical expressions on Wikipedia [1] informs me that there are then two kinds of causes: necessary causes and sufficient causes. To my understanding, necessary causes are, obviously, necessities, and all of the necessary causes combine to form a single sufficient cause, motivating the effect thereafter. Sufficient causes, on the other hand, can single-handedly enable the effect, in other words, the first sufficient cause is a necessary cause, but no particular one is a necessity. It then becomes crucial to distinguish whether a cause is necessary, sufficient, or both. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; But what we've resolved thus far is only that there are different kinds of causes, but nothing about what a cause actually is. And how can we talk about causation without mentioning its ugly sibling, the fundamental point of confusion: correlation? Putting that aside momentarily, though, let's delve into the problem of induction, the line of reasoning that infers future from past. This is perhaps the most crucial concept in the scientific inquiry, which ironically is not the concern of scientists, falling instead in the domains of philosophy of science. The problem of induction has been discussed by Western philosophers (*the extent of my knowledge from a 200-level course) dating back to ancient Greece, sprinkled with resolutions from prominent mathematicians and scientists, but the problem still stands: any experimental observations cannot be guaranteed to apply to the future. To put it more bluntly, "causation" has no place in the future in that one cannot extrapolate "A causes B" with 100% confidence. Actually, in that sense, correlation holds just as little water in the future, protected only by the margin of error we've given ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, we can relieve ourselves in eliminating the concerns of the future, at least for now, and simply ask: did A cause B in our past observations? In Granger's original econometric causality paper [2], he states, or rather, defines, causality as "Y is causing X if we are better able to predict X using all available information than if the information apart from Y had been used." In other words, since we don't quite know what we mean by "causing", we will just define A to be causing B if A's past <em>correlates</em> with B's present (or future, as observed in the past). This can be quite rigorously measured, and extends naturally into intuitively causal relationships, such as the fingers hitting the keyboard. The crucial insight here is that, <em>Y's past is a better predictor of X's future than X's past itself, given all available information</em>. In a way, Y can be thought of as an orthogonal linear basis in the causal space of X, along with many others, hidden and visible. Indeed, imagine letters appearing on the screen: no other variable correlates with the appearance of a specific letter on the screen better than the pressing of a specific key, other than perhaps the command signals residing in our nervous system. Additionally, Granger adds the qualifier that for non-stationary processes, the existence of causality may not be constant over time. On the one hand, this is quite a reasonable statement in itself, given the metric defined, as well as the unpredictable nature of non-stationary processes. On the other hand, though, it does nothing for our intuition, as the question remains still: how is A causing B if A only causes B sometimes?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will conclude the referenced discussion here, with the disclaimer that Granger intended this type of causality to be only applicable in economics [2], and perhaps other social (read:vague) sciences. I'm confident that I will revisit this discussion in due time, likely after absorbing more of the historical discussions that have preceded me. As for now, I am satisfied with the separation of causality in philosophical terms versus in scientific terms, borrowing from Granger's Causality. I think we can all agree that correlation is necessary for causation and that, as discussed above, strong correlation in the face of all available information is as good as causation. But as a reasoning human being, it's been hard to reconcile this lack of causation with my linear line of reasoning- if A then B. Although, it seems that scientists and successful thinkers alike have become extremely proficient at forgoing this notion of cause and effect, which may or may not turn out to be fool's gold. Instead, the pragmatic focuses on maximizing certainty in correlations, and leaves the absolute to the philosophers.</p><p class="text-align-center">_____</p><p>[1]&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px">Wikipedia contributors.

      <title>My Biggest Fear Realized</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/5/10/my-biggest-fear-realized</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>May 10, 2014 - My Biggest Fear Realized</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This is really a continuation of last week's piece, and I feel like I've already written about this part of my life to death but since it's actually come to an end, hey, why not? Also, having had to re-read what I wrote two years ago (and last week), I must say I hate it. It's like a diary entry in which my intended audience is myself, but I try to make it funny as if other people should be able to enjoy it. My blog should have been called: "You should read my self-indulgent ranting and you should like it!" Well...I'll work on separating the self-reflection here and there from the actual useful/entertaining material. The least I can do for you (uh..who?) is to insert some outside perspective or research.</p><p class="text-align-center"><span style="font-size:14px">_____</span></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The biggest fear of my life thus far, simply put, is to not be in school, summarized quite nicely in a Tumblr post I wrote two years ago:</p><blockquote><p>"I’ve been truly afraid of two things: one, finishing school, resulting in not having another environment to compete and be evaluated with quantifiable statistics, wins and losses; and two, staying in (a good) school long enough such that I’ve finally been pushed to the edge of my limits, resulting in me no longer being able to compete with my peers at a respectable level.&nbsp;"</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, now that it's all said and done, how do I feel? I feel surprisingly at peace. Granted, I'm going right back to it all in graduate school, but it's not the thought that I will be assigned grades again that gives me peace, rather, it's knowing that I'm tired of getting graded by my transcript on a bi-annual basis. Even though the reality of life is that we're constantly measured by some kind of objective metric- grades, publication counts, or salary- those things can only be just that: objective. Objective meaning it enables an outside party to measure, in a controlled manner, the value of you and your work. While these metrics are by no means useless to those judging my value, it is completely useless, if not anti-useful (what?), in my determination of my own value. Stocks fall and rise on the daily, and if the company is run by a self-conscious 18-year old boy, the mission statement would probably change on the daily to reflect that ("Apple is dedicated in providing the best user experience possible...but just a bit less so than yesterday").&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The thing is, for an 18-year old Richard that knew very well how to achieve great objective evaluations, why would he ever want to give that up in search for what he values in himself? If picking my nose everyday gets me praises from my teachers, parents, and friends, you bet I would do that everyday and do a damn good job at it. But somewhere along the way, maybe aided by the impending doom of getting out of school, I've had to realize all the things getting good grades DIDN'T get me: it didn't get me a Google job, or a MIT admission, and worst of all, it didn't get me the knowledge I thought I'd learned BY getting those grades. I mean, sure, I still know how to do a derivative like I'm brushing my teeth, but I read over my quantum physics notes the other day, and the only thought I had was "how the F did I get an A in that class"?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So here I am, scared shitless about finding what I value in myself, and consequently, what values I can bring to the people and society around me. But I do know that my ability to take in information and regurgitating it well is only a fraction of package I can provide to the world. Don't get me wrong, I still love good grades because it gets me scholarships, and I love money because it'll let me buy a house and car for my family someday. But what I'll have to remind myself of every single day is that, the values I can create should be much more than what can be measured by grades and dollars. And when I am doing that regularly and strategically, everything else, along with my inner peace, will come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Moving Forward</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/5/1/moving-forward</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I wish I could come up with a better title for this very first piece, but I have to settle for the compromise between giving it too much, and at the same time, too little, importance. On the one hand, it marks the end of a wonderfully agonizing and perpetually exhilarating journey that is my undergraduate career in EngSci, having made countless memories with a handful of <em>framily&nbsp;</em>(at the lack of a better word for the loss of distinction between friends and family, thanks Sprint Mobile). Not only that, it marks what every undergraduate deems to be the beginning of "real life"- the interface between excitement and fear, between finally being responsible for yourself and, gasp, <em>being responsible</em>.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the other hand, it is just another day. I fully acknowledge that I have a need to take on this party-pooping persona that is half rational, half critical, and half afraid of giving something too much meaning in case it doesn't ever live up to my expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; And so, it is on this day- a day of ending and beginning in every sense, but a day unceremoniously residing in its square on the calendar, preceded and preceding thousands more- that I start the documentary that is my little blog on my own website. I wondered whether writing my thoughts on the internet would come to bite me in the back, whether be it for my professional or personal relationships, maybe because I'm cussing too much or that I'm telling a story or opinion that I wasn't really suppose to.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In the end, I can't say how that was resolved, but I just know that I am going to do it. I'm going to dedicate time to myself, once every week, whether to practice thinking, fleshing out an idea, documenting an event, or just polishing my writing for the sake of writing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe I should have called it&nbsp;<em>Self-Titled.&nbsp;</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Book Thoughts: The Fault In Our Stars</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/16/book-thoughts-the-fault-in-our-stars</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>June 16</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I picked up The Fault In Our Stars by John Green (NERDFIGHTER) in hopes of finishing it this week so I (we, really) can watch the movie. I'm on chapter 4 right now and I've got some mixed feelings about it. Let me preface this by saying that my literary taste is my own, and I'm by no means a book critic, as you will see by my struggling to use the proper literary terms. That's why this is titled "Book Thoughts", not "Book Review". Also, <strong>spoiler alert</strong>, probably.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After the first chapter, I must say I hated it. I've never read any of the Twilight books, but I imagine that it would be very close to what TFIOS feels like after one chapter. The dialogue between Hazel and Augustus was unrealistically witty and quick-paced, which made it feel artificial- even mechanical- especially for two people (TEENAGERS) that had just met. If I had to describe it using two words, it would be "teenage fantasy". It then dawned on me that I shouldn't have been surprised since this is probably why it was SO popular, but nevertheless I WAS surprised that John Green could produce such a work. Not that it's bad- whatever that means- just not what I expected. Although I think I watched a lot more of Hank Green on YouTube than John Green so I'm not sure what I should expect... In any case, the book slows down a bit after the second chapter, which makes it a lot more balanced and digestable. This might also be due to the fact that I could not, at all, relate to the perspective of Hazel (a cancer-surviving 16-year-old &nbsp;Caucasian girl from Indiana who watches America's Next Top Model) in the first chapter, whereas the switch of focus onto Augustus' story in chapter two made it feel more familiar.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The most prominent thing so far is the level of detail to which JG describes the cancer-related emotions of Hazel, more so the mundane, everyday thoughts, which led me to conclude the following 3 possibilities: 1) he made it all up; 2) he was close to someone through it all; and 3) he did his homework in interviewing patients. Whichever the case, hats off to him, and despite the teenage-feel of the book, I still have high hopes for the rest of it.</p><p class="text-align-center">_____</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Two more chapters in, and it reminded me that reading (fictions), aside from its primary function of imparting some story or wisdom, often ends up being a mirror that reflects who you are. It makes sense, really, since you get to experience countless things without ever needing to move from your chair, all the while being able to reflect and be selective about which of these experiences you actually liked. Back to TFIOS: after two more chapters, the whole thing has now become a polarized experience, with an extremely awkward interface that feels like what you get after mixing orange juice and milk and leave it sitting for too long. Yeah, the curdles.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The parts I enjoyed the most are the simpler dialogues and richer narratives, a la Hazel Grace. In my humble opinion, this is what real life is like: mundane and un-extraordinary conversations sprinkled between internal thoughts full of texture. It makes her very relatable, even with the whole cancer thing going on- just replace her worries with the worries of your own. The parts I hated are, still, the extravagantly witty correspondence between Hazel Grace and Gus- actually just Gus in general. Not because he's a bad guy, not at all, and this corresponds to the part about how the book becomes a reflection of yourself. Gus reminded me of my teenage years, trying so hard to say the right words with the right balance of wit and humor in the right quantity. It's calculated and difficult. The fact that he does it so effortlessly makes it even easier to dislike him. Worse yet, what he represents- (one-legged) knight in a shining armor- reminds me of how much I hate teen fiction and rom-coms. Put it crudely, this is an erotic novel for teenage girls. To be honest, though, there were moments where I can almost enjoy it in a giddy, guilty-pleasure kind of way, especially the interaction between the two. Almost. Which is why I don't usually read books like this. Here's the kick in the balls though: you hate Gus because he's the perfect guy (again, leg thing notwithstanding...), but you root for him because he makes her so, damn, happy (hoooold up hold up hold up, FLYING TO AMSTERDAM, GUUURL?!?). Literally, he's the boyfriend you always wish you could be, but would hate when he's the guy that shows you up in front of all the girls.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Screw you John Green, for raising yet again girls' expectation of guys, while making guys feel inadequate. Or is it just me?</p><p class="text-align-center">_____</p><p>June 21</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Alright, so I ended up reading the rest of the book (25 chapters in all, so ~18 chapters) in two days. I didn't have an opportunity to organize my thoughts into something coherent after every couple of chapters, but for some reason I had the foresight to take screenshots of the pages in which a particular section triggered some thought, so I was able to leverage that to formulate these comments because otherwise I would have forgotten about it for sure.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The book, as a whole, got much better from the first chapter (by which I mean, again, I like it more) as it came down to Earth and the interactions between all parties felt very real, which I guess was JG's intended effect, although you never know since most of the cheeseball Twilight stuff is still present. There are a lot more of the observations that I like, in place of those witty conversations, for example, the following:</p><blockquote>"The weird thing about houses is that they almost always look like nothing is happening inside of them, even though they contain most of our lives."</blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This feels very John Green-y, which I liked, probably because this is the exact kind of thing I would say to annoy the hell out of my friends. Aside from these neat tidbits, though, I really enjoyed these other aspects of the book as the story matured:</p><p>1. The existential crisis faced by Augustus, as a dying teen and as a person in general. For one, I can relate to his obsession, which, of course, made the book more enjoyable as a whole. I don't know what to make of my own desperate attempt to leave a mark in this world, with one particular exchange between Hazel Grace and Augustus haunting my conscience, which entails the question: how many lives do you have to touch to feel like it was enough? I won't get into this topic here with regards to my personal views, but yeah, I enjoyed it. Side note, it was revealed that Hazel Grace liked the real Augustus than the charismatic Augustus, which is obviously the whole point of the book (really, this being its redeeming quality &nbsp;to set itself apart from Twilight), but I still enjoyed that revelation which made me like her more.</p><p>2. The novelization of a particular story into something much more magnificent than it is, merely because it was told. I can't remember exactly where, but at some point in the story, I thought to myself, well what about all the other kids that have cancer? Would the story have been told the way it is if they weren't two upper-middle class Caucasian kids? Or if Gus wasn't as good-looking as he was, would the book have existed at all? What made this pair of cancer stories more significant than any others? Because it was fake? Yes, I do realize that it is a novel and that none of this was real, but the point is that, the stories we hear serve as prototypes in our minds, and we compare every other [real-life] cancer story, or whatever story, to their fictionalized counterparts. John Green, being the genius he is, touched upon that directly a few chapters later, as HG examined the book of names at the Anne Frank house. It didn't feel like a satisfactory enough answer, but he's not the arbiter of all truth so it doesn't really matter, besides, I don't know what would have been a satisfactory enough answer to start with.&nbsp;</p><p>3. I always thought, from the outset, the two kids were idiots for wanting to get the answer out of Van Houten, regarding what had happened to Anna's mom and the hamster and whatever else. However childish they were, though, they remind us of our own childish whims, our needs to seek answers from an arbitrary universe. I'm starting to think that, the day we grow up is the day where we realize it, "shit, nobody here knows the <strong>truth</strong> any more than I do"- not our parents, not the government, and especially not our science teachers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There were some other things, and I might add to this as I think about it some more, but this is the meat of my cursory analysis. As a whole, it's a good short read and I enjoyed this book. It's insightful (a la John Green), funny (again), honest, and lively. I enjoyed it like you would enjoy a movie with a good moral and some great actions (aka the romance)- except I didn't quite get off on the actions. I mean there were parts, as I wrote before, that made me think and appreciate the emotional aspect of this whole ordeal. But yeah, it's just not my genre of book. Actually, that's a great analogy (so proud of myself): reading TFIOS as a 23-year old male is like watching the Dark Knight trilogy but not knowing who the fuck Batman is and not caring about the action, while appreciating the chaos and struggle. I don't know who these people are, but I feel like them. Meanwhile, I guess I didn't like it more because it wasn't really a happy ending. I mean, even before I picked up the book I knew one of them was going to die in the end. Still, who doesn't like a happy ending? But then again, this is as real life as real life gets, so, kudos to John Green for keepin' it real.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Prayers and love to the victims and their family, but only after you get these assault rifles off the streets.</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/6/13/prayers-and-love-to-the-victims-and-their-family-but-only-after-you-get-these-assault-rifles-off-the-streets</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I went to a friend's place to celebrate having made it through our second year of graduate school together. There was great company and plenty to drink, and at some point we called it a night and I went to sleep on their couch. Next thing I know, it was the morning and I woke up. Didn't feel like the world's greatest, but I woke up.</p><p>Shortly after, I learned that, just as we celebrated our lives last night, many more were celebrating their own, in a club across the country. The only difference was, 50 of them never woke up this morning.&nbsp;And of the hundreds that did, their lives were probably changed forever.</p><p>When I first heard of this, my instinctive reaction was "wow...Murica, I guess." I didn't think much more about it and went on to eat a big meal of chicken waffles, thinking that this will be just another hung-over Sunday. But for some reason, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I couldn't stop thinking about it and I couldn't stop reading about it, and the more I read, the more confused I felt. I was confused about why I was so sad and angry. Not to sound callous, but usually reading the news doesn't get me riled up anymore, because, well, shit happens. Shit happens all over the world, and usually there is a reason for it -&nbsp;be it civil unrest, religious conflict, or domestic dispute. And usually, reason alone is enough for me to shrug my shoulders and move on. But I couldn't today, and I finally realized why:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There is no fucking reason why a civilian in this country should be able to leave a store with a legally purchased AR-15, a semi-automatic, military-grade (M16) assault rifle. None at all.</strong></p><p>Reading about events like this, it's certainly guaranteed that you will run into a gamut of knee-jerk reactions, be it on social media or "real" news outlets. Of course, there is the anti-Islam reaction, and we were graced with the Donald's personal and thoughtful opinion on this matter. That's fine, you know what, I get it. If some dude pledges allegiance to ISIS and shoots up the city, I can see why a conservative and traditional American upbringing can lead you to have that fear reaction. I don't think it's reasonable, but I can see why, and I don't know how to solve this problem either. There is also the reaction of sending love to the LGBT community, and how intolerance towards a different life choice indoctrinated by an Islamic (or religious, in general) upbringing is to be lamented over (and of course, politicians' prayers). Finally, as always, a peak in interest in mental health often co-occurs with mass shootings, though it wasn't so prominent today since, well, it wasn't a white dude.&nbsp;All of these reactions are warranted and reasonable, and they deserve further discussion. Of course, Islamic extremism is a real security issue and needs to be treated with sensitivity, not with a dogmatic and militant viewpoint (be it left- or right-leaning). And of course, mental health and discrimination against the LGBT community are also real and persistent issues that deserve our attention. But frankly, I don't think today is the time and place for those things, because <strong>talking about ISIS or gay-intolerance takes the attention off of a very real and tangible problem</strong>:</p><p>How do you prevent one mentally unstable person from killing 50 people in a crowded place?</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out:&nbsp;maybe you shouldn't sell them a fucking machine design to kill many people very, very quickly. This is just fucking absurd. If I could use all the cuss words in my lifetime today to describe how ridiculous this situation is, I would. Because it is just, absolutely, fucking, absurd. Instead of having the Islam debate or the homophobic debate -&nbsp;which, again, are important things to talk about but have no clear course of action -&nbsp;every single media outlet should focus on the only thing we know for certain, which is that had the shooter not have a semi-automatic ASSAULT RIFLE, he wouldn't have been able to kill 50 and injure many more in a matter of minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>My sadness, anger, and frustration stems solely from this incomprehensible fact. Like I said before, people die all the time, and it sucks, but most of the time I don't get too worked up because you can conjure up some high-level explanation for it. But for this, today, there is no explanation. And it REALLY hit me when I read the first article that linked it to Sandy Hook, in referencing it as the worst mass shooting in American history. Why? Because I completely forgot about Sandy Hook, and that's the scariest thing about this. News stories will inevitably fall off in popularity, at which point we can move on to be outraged by the next thing. But we cannot afford to just move on from this. There is no discussion needed as to what could be done to prevent things like this from happening again. Yes, if he wasn't an ISIS sympathizer or a terrorist, it probably wouldn't have happened; and yes,&nbsp;if he wasn't a homophobe, it probably wouldn't have happened - probably! But we know for CERTAIN that if those rifles had not been accessible, 50 people would not have died. Maybe 3 or 5 in a knife fight, and that would be another regular day at the night club. But not 50, and not potentially more when he held the remaining people hostage. You can't hold a building hostage with a goddamn knife.&nbsp;</p><p>Just in case you're really hung up on one of the other "causes" of this tragedy, consider this: it could've easily been a white, non-religious shooter, and it could've easily been at a mall or a school or a movie theatre. Easily. Not convinced? Well, they all happened, in the last 5 years. <strong>And the only thing linking these tragedies? Not ISIS, but the very <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-massacre/ar-15-rifle-used-orlando-massacre-has-bloody-pedigree-n590581">same assault rifle</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I don't have anything intelligent to say about the Islamic situation, because I don't know if he was inspired, brainwashed, or just hijacked for publicity. But I will just say this: if you are one of those people that are dead set about this being about ISIS and an act of terrorism, then you should agree that somebody should be responsible for arming these goddamn terrorists. Supplying firepower to a member of a terrorist organization is a criminal offense and is not far from treason, so should we not prosecute the arms seller and manufacturer?</p><p>I don't really know where I'm going with this anymore, except for the fact that I'm still simultaneously fucking livid and heartbroken. It just baffles me. It just feels like we can actually DO SOMETHING about this, but I don't know what!&nbsp;How do you get the politicians to get their heads out of somebody else's ass so they can do something reasonable and think about the consequences of any old Joe being able to walk into a gun store and buy a military-grade assault weapon? How???</p><p><strong>You know what, my American friends, if you feel the same way about this or perhaps know somebody that have the insight as to what we can do, please share this, because I just don't understand why this is happening over and over again, and I don't want to have the pleasure of being this worked up over yet another tragedy in the near future.</strong></p><p>And you know what's really ironic in all of this?&nbsp;I'm fucking Canadian.</p><p>Please, fix your goddamn country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On Doing-Nothing: At the Dentist's</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing-nothing has been losing ground to doing-something at a very fast pace, with the pervasiveness of the interwebs and hand-held entertainment steadily permeating through every crevice of our lives. It's been my personal experience, though, that great thoughts often come while I'm doing doing-nothing, but that is not to guarantee that all thoughts arising during doing-nothing are great. Without further ado, here we are:&nbsp;doing-nothing.</p><hr /><ul dir="ltr"><li>I don't eat a lot of sweets, and I'd like to think that I'm still pretty young, although my knees and Mei sometimes tell me otherwise. What that means for my dentist is that he doesn't need to see me more than once every 3-6 months (read: a year), and when I do see him, I don't REALLY see him. I get to see yet another rotating dental hygienist.</li><li>I hope that's a product of my absence, or that they're all off to better things in life, as opposed to getting fired.</li><li>Few things in life require consciousness but put absolute restrictions on movement, physical and mental, while providing nearly zero emotional stimulus. They often involve sitting on a chair while another person hovers around you. Not all visits to the dentist are like that, but getting your teeth cleaned falls squarely in that category of activities. Another is getting your hair cut, though that depends on how anal you are about your hair, I suppose.</li><li>"Do your teeth hurt?"<br />"No."<br />"Do they bleed when you brush?"<br />"No."<br />"Do you floss everyday?"<br />*hahaha...* "No."</li><li>I always wonder whether I will fall asleep. I wonder if anybody ever falls asleep while getting their teeth cleaned.</li><li>I forgot: you can't fall asleep. If I close my eyes, I feel eerily similar to lying in my bed, having just woken up but not wanting to get up, but not being able to fall back asleep because the sun is shining right in my face and yet another construction crew dutifully started drilling holes in the ground at 9 in the morning. The world always needs more holes to be drilled into the ground.</li><li>For the majority of the time, the hygienist uses a single tool. It makes a screeching kind of noise via conduction when it makes contact with my teeth. I have yet to figure out whether it's a high-pressure water gun or a rotary filer.&nbsp;</li><li>Is that the sound of my teeth screaming?</li><li>With my eyes closed, my attention drifts between the jarring noise I'm trying to ignore, and the endless Top-40 tunes coming out of the radio. Did someone at some point decide that's the best thing to do? Is silence too sterile and horrifying with all the buzzing of these medical instruments? Would playing classical music inadvertently fulfill our stereotype of a doctor's visit? I already feel like I'm in a movie though: I'm the extra in the dental office where Bruce Willis is about to burst through in an attempt to escape from some henchmen.&nbsp;</li><li>God, sitting in that chair makes it incredibly easy to think about the millions of people living their own lives in the city. If I were to guess, they will probably be doing "nothing". I'm doing nothing, but the hygienist is working her day job.&nbsp;</li><li>"Uh", "hmm", and "uh-huh" suddenly conveys WAY more information when I'm sitting in that chair.</li><li>How much pain is normal? I definitely don't want to stop her and tell her it hurts like hell if that's what everybody else gets as well, but if I don't say anything, would she somehow realize that she's scraping my gums? Am I just soft or weird?</li><li>Nope, she definitely knows she's scraping my gums. Apparently I need to floss more. Who doesn't?</li><li>In the instant I'm supposed to spit out the water I just gurgled, there is a huge clash of what I suddenly want with my life. On the one hand, I want to see that water muddied with all sorts of plaque and stains.&nbsp;On the other hand, I hope I see nothing...&nbsp;nothing but water.&nbsp;</li><li>The hygienist ends the visit by calling the dentist over. The speed and ease at which he inspects my teeth tells me that he's either the best or the worst dentist in that building, possibly in the city. I will never know.</li></ul><hr /><p>And that is all from today's episode of On Doing-Nothing.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>It's just a game: Goodnight Mr. Bryant</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/4/14/8df9t5x8h30h5i09hwzozllk4ogibh</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone plays sports, and not everyone can relate to sports. Be it basketball, football, golf, what have you. Certainly not everyone enjoys debating numbers, rankings, statistics, and playoff seedings.&nbsp;Sometimes it's hard to even get past the ridiculous 30-second ads, shoe deals, and the rampant commercialism holding millions of people hostage for a few hours in front of their TVs on any given Sunday, dying to be entertained. Does it even matter who wins and when, when we all have to go back to our lives when the final horn goes off? Probably not. It is, after all, just a game.</p><p>I have a poster, of Michael Jordan spreading his wings, hung up in my room. Arguably the greatest player the game has seen, his lore transcends through generations and cultures.&nbsp;Even though I've never watched him play a single game, I know the numbers,&nbsp;I know 72 and 10,&nbsp;the 6 rings, the 3peats, the tongue held out in flight, the fist pump,&nbsp;and the maniacal drive to crush the opposition. I know all of that, but to me, Michael was a player in a game.</p><p>We can't relate to players in a game, multi-millionaires with big houses and fast cars, with athleticism we can't even imagine trapped in our own bodies, and with a day job that is, quite frankly, cutting them cheques to play a game.</p><p>But we can relate to a narrative.</p><p>We don't know, or think, but we feel, when we are swallowed whole into a storyline unfolding in realtime. A storyline that many of us have been a part of from teenage to adulthood.&nbsp;We cherish these last few moments disproportionately more, even if they are not as glorious. Somehow having the end in sight makes everything weigh a little bit more in our hearts. We know what that feels like. The last farewell is not one of fierce competition, but of mutual appreciation.</p><p>We can relate to futility, of running up and down and up again, feeling like the world is against you. Worse, the feeling that maybe today won't make a difference to neither the winner nor the loser. Beyond the futility, we can relate to sadness, of the imminent departure of someone you know, or even someone you felt like you know.</p><p>But we can also relate to thumping our chest for coming in clutch time after time, maybe on our own day jobs. I haven't been to Phoenix,&nbsp;I heard it gets hot there. And as life will have it, we can relate to shame and horror, for being on the wrong side of history. I am from Toronto, after all.</p><p>We can relate to pride and utter confidence, for when we are in our elements, we are appreciated for our momentarily extraordinary feats of aptitude, even if it is a minuscule one in the bigger picture. On the flip side, we can relate to pain and bitterness of being tossed aside, when we're down,&nbsp;for the next new thing around.</p><p>We can relate to feeling pure, childish foolishness, moments after being so bewildered by what's happening in front of our eyes that we expect the screen to scream back in disbelief with us. Simultaneously, somehow, we can relate to defiance, and to refusal to being quietly sent off into obscurity, from yesterday's dominance to a page in tomorrow's obituary. We can relate to ending our stories on our own terms, because it's our stories.</p><p>And when things slow down,&nbsp;we can relate to having friends and family being there for us, through the ups and downs, through the 9 to 5, or from sunrise till sundown. Our individual glory would not have been possible if not for every single one of our companions on this journey. Although,&nbsp;some of them might have been liabilities more than opportunities, but falling down a ditch together makes for good friends and better stories.</p><p>We can relate to ambition, obsession, and hard work; and with it, blood, sweat, and sweet victory. Maybe we can't relate to legacies but we can relate to forever trying to create our own, of perhaps what will be become decades of excellence in a history book full of colorful chapters, decorated accomplishments, and inevitable regrets.</p><p>We can relate to excitement and exhilaration seemingly coming out of nowhere, suspending, for just a moment, our belief that none of this matters.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it doesn't. But when it's all over,&nbsp;we can relate to relishing in the moment and the feeling of peace that washes over us, knowing that today's story will end and tomorrow's will come. Maybe "81" has passed but "73 and 9" is the moment we can live for right now.</p><p>We can feel all of that, but at the end of the day, maybe it is just a game.</p><p>Thank you, for taking the world by its throat, when it mattered a lot and when it didn't. Thank you, for creating storylines after storylines that we can relate to while we walk through ours, even if our worlds couldn't be farther apart. And finally,&nbsp;thank you, for playing your game, and in the process, inspiring us to play ours.</p>

      <title>In a situation like this, words, let alone hashtags, truly cannot capture how you feel.</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/11/14/in-a-situation-like-this-words-let-alone-hashtags-truly-cannot-capture-how-you-feel</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I debated with myself for a long time whether I should write this, partly because I try not to make social commentaries online in fear of ending up on the wrong side of internet famous, and partly because I just don't know what I would say. But after hours of contemplation, the message I wanted to send materialized, and with it, how I wanted to craft it. If you're going to read it, read the whole thing, because I say some pretty stupid things in the middle.</p><p>I first heard about the Paris events yesterday afternoon, so I popped open BBC news on my phone and promptly realized that it was so recent that even BBC had no idea what had happened yet, nor was there reports on ISIS or any Islamic involvement, only that 100 people were killed in a mass shooting and bombing. My first reaction? "Wow, again? Although...it's weird that it's in France,&nbsp;don't they have better gun control over there?" Honestly, that was it. Why? Because it seems that every week somebody somewhere decides to shoot up a bunch of innocent people, and frankly I'm getting pretty desensitized about it because sitting on the toilet at school reading BBC without a kill count would be a rare day. I'm not saying that's an okay reaction to have, I'm just telling you what I thought.</p><p>Anyway, then I went about my day as usual. I was on a writing roll, so time went by pretty quickly, then I had to go to a hockey game, but before I left the house I checked Facebook, and saw the status updates rolling in. "Praying for Paris." Honestly, if it wasn't for the fact that I had to run out, I think I might have said something stupid on Facebook. Because my first reaction to this, as it always is, was "this is fucking stupid." First of all, how many people that were praying for Paris actually uttered a prayer? What would you even say? Yes, your thoughts are with Paris, but why does Facebook need to know? Second of all, how many people actually had French friends ON Facebook? I'd understand if it was Canada or America, and we wanted to show support for our friends and family, but in this case, for the majority of people I knew on Facebook, literally nobody affected is going to see any of this, so what the hell are we doing? (Ironic enough, I happen to have French friends. If you're reading this, hope everything's well).</p><p>Like I said, that was my immediate thought,&nbsp;and judging by some backlash on social media, I wasn't the only person thinking that way, though I salute your bravery and stupidity if you had actually said/typed that out loud. I was mildly annoyed, but went to an otherwise enjoyable hockey game with some friends in the department, where surprisingly, none of us mentioned anything of Paris until the ride home. However, I did have a brief moment to chat to my better half on the instant messages (yay technology), and in between my transcription of an unusually exciting minor league hockey game,&nbsp;I put in a rare complaint about how stupid I thought the whole hashtag activism was. I was then promptly enlightened as I was told to imagine what it would be like if this had happen in my own peaceful city. I still maintain that the status updates does absolutely nothing for Paris, for the people that died, and arguably little for the living people of the city, but it got me thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>Then I came home, got on Facebook.&nbsp;Bad idea: the world was going to shits.&nbsp;</p><p>Paris gets shot up by Islamic extremists, so the world shows support via #prayforparis. Then,&nbsp;somebody got angry that there had been a bombing earlier this week, in Lebanon, with almost no news coverage. So the #prayforbeirut guys got angry at the #prayforparis guys for being hypocritical and selective activists. I honestly didn't even know about the Lebanese bombing because I guess I didn't go on BBC on Thursday, probably worrying shitless (no toilet trips, get it?) about my midterm. In any case, that somehow invoked the social justice warrior within me to condemn the hypocrisy of the Western world, EVEN THOUGH I had no fucking clue that it had even happened before this whole Paris chaos. Okay. Then somebody else got angry that nobody's been paying attention to the daily tragedies going on in the Middle East, nobody fucking prayed for Turkey when THEY got bombed in the middle of a goddamn peace rally, and certainly nobody prayed for Syria, because, well, then you'd have to update your status to "prayforsyria" pretty much every single day for the past 3 years. So now we have #prayforparis, #prayforbeirut, #prayforsyria, and the best one, #prayforeveryone &amp; #prayfortheworld. Then things got kind of weird, people started posting things like thousands of innocent people get shot in America by the cops, so #prayforblacks.</p><p>And of course, there was what I had feared the most, Islamphobia. I have Muslim friends, and this is not like a white-folks-saying "I have black friends" kind of thing. No, I have Muslim friends who are - by no means is this derogatory - regular fucking people. So it doesn't only hurt my brain how illogical it is to group all Muslims with 8 idiots who may or may not even be actually Muslim, it pains me to think that this is yet another round of gas top-up for those that are looking for an excuse to be bigoted. Seriously, if nobody says Christians are terrorists by quoting the KKK and the Westboro Baptist Church, why is it okay to equate some random bumfuck terrorists with good people living all around you? Fine, white America wants to hate on Muslims, go ahead, it's not the worst thing. The worst is when people are rallying behind this for political action against Syrian refugees AND heavier military involvement in Syria. Canada recently pulled out of operations against ISIS, so naturally people took the opportunity here to say, well, we done goofed. My question is, how can any of us have the balls to make a political statement like that when there clearly is no solid evidence for either being a good solution? I'm not saying I know what the best thing to do is, but I'm pretty confident that none of us do.</p><p>Why are we all so angry?</p><p>All of this was last night, at which point I thought, maybe I should unplug. But I couldn't go to sleep because my microwave broke and I was oven-baking some food since I had the munchies after one too many 2 dollar beer at the game. So I just sat there. I really wanted to write something, but I didn't know what it was, so I didn't, because I knew it was going to be yet another commentary on how some group of you were stupid and unreasonable for saying one thing but not the other, and I didn't really have a message to send to anyone, other than maybe "hey you should all listen to me because I figured it out", all the while feeling confused as ever about why there is so much random outrage.</p><p>Sitting around doing nothing has a weird effect of making you think, and it was thanks to my traditional oven taking forever to do a job that my microwave would have done in 2 minutes, that I realized I was really sad, and scared, and angry, and frustrated. I was all of those things that were not directed at anyone, but just was. I didn't think I was that sad about Paris when I first read about it, but it turns out, I was. I've been to Paris, it's beautiful on a Friday night. It's beautiful on any night, really. It has an atmosphere of carefreeness and spontaneous magic that was almost true to what the movies made it look like.&nbsp;All the lights turn on and people enjoy themselves and have a good time sitting by the river, outside cafes, wherever. It's incredibly saddening to imagine the chaos on an otherwise peaceful and joyous weekend night. It's even more painful and scary to think about what it would've been like if it was in my city, if it was my friends and family that I had to fear the lives for. Then I was frustrated, about why this even happened, feeling ever more helpless that there really is no clear solution to this, to the Syrian tragedy, to people dying namelessly, to why, apparently,&nbsp;a father of two kids had to sacrifice himself and jump the second bomber in Beirut to save the lives of everyone going to market. What the hell am I, or are any of us, supposed to do? Meanwhile, I'm really confused as to what the government is supposed to do, and why everyone thinks they know what the best thing is. If I hadn't known better, I would've mistaken my Facebook feed for a Parliament gathering because of all the discussions going on.</p><p>Then I realized this: people on my Facebook and Twitter feed are JUST people. My friends, colleagues, people from school I've never ever talked to, random people I've met - regular ass people. And if I was feeling all these ways about what had happened, and what's been happening, then maybe they are too? Maybe #prayingforparis is not suppose to do anything for Paris, but for us? Maybe we're all scared, alone, and frustrated, and #prayingforparis and beirut and syria and blacks and everyone is not a suggestion for action, but a reach-out to be consoled, feel united, and be reassured that somebody out there will care about us in the same way and make sure that we're safe from these senseless tragedies. Maybe people don't realize that they're feeling this way, maybe they're not even feeling this way, but it certainly made me see everything in a different light. Instead of thinking that every hashtag was stupid, I should've realized that behind every hashtag was another individual that was rocked by Paris, Beirut, and Syria. But for some reason, we don't want to express that. We want to express WHY we should be sad about Paris versus Lebanon, WHY it's not okay that one thing is getting more media coverage than the other, WHY the Western world should care about the Middle East just as much as it cares about France. But that's not why we post these statuses. We all know that status updates don't save lives, neither does putting our profile photo behind a French flag. I hope I'm not senselessly optimistic when I say that I really do believe that we, as humans, just want to feel less sad and less powerless. So I'm really, really sorry I thought your status update was stupid (in my head).&nbsp;Maybe I was the only person, if so, then I'm sorry for being a Judgemental Judy - I'm slow to empathize.</p><p>And then I realized what my message was: let's stop judging each other for which hashtag and status updates we choose. Nobody likes a social justice warrior no matter what you're fighting for. Instead, just stop and think for a moment, process our own emotions, and console everyone about their own plights. No one is wrong in feeling sad or angry about Paris or Beirut or anywhere for that matter. It's a fucked up thing that happened. But don't offer up solutions, because nobody - not me, not you, not Obama -&nbsp;knows what the hell they're talking about.</p><p>Instead, go hug someone, or call or email someone, and tell them how you really feel. I'm sorry this happened, and that these things continue to happen all around the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Over the weekend, many of you participated in my little psychology experiment for a course. Before I go into it, I just want to give a shout out to all those that responded, which was way more than I had expected. Even the couple of you that gave non-sense answers &gt;_&gt;.....your effort is duly noted.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So what was the mumbojumbo about? Well for anyone that didn't do the survey, you can give it a try <a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/forms/kpiYExG4jM">here</a> before reading on. The complete write-up is <a href="/s/Assignment1.pdf">here</a>, it's a bit tongue-in-cheek because I thought this whole project was a waste of time, so it might be an enjoyable read, though it's probably easier to just read the summary that I'm about to write.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The experiment was an adaptation of a study done around 30 years ago. The original question that was posed to participants was as follows:&nbsp;</p><p><em>Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.</em><br />Which is more probable?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Linda is a bank teller.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surprisingly (or not), the original finding was that way more people chose the second, the conjunction of the two probabilities, as more likely than the first, henceforth dubbed the conjunction fallacy. To see why option 2 is NOT more likely, consider that 2 is a subset of 1, and for 2 to occur, 1 must also occur, hence 1 will always be equally or more likely than 2. Formally put, the probability of two events P(A,B), will always be less than the probability of its constituents: P(A,B) &lt; P(A), P(B).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Half of you that have done the survey and is currently reading is probably thinking to yourself, "well shit", because that's how many of you screwed this up, 50%. Despite what I thought about the project, I DID think that more of my sample population would do better, since most of my Facebook associates are university grads and probably have a degree in a STEM field. Worry not though. In the past 30 years, this experiment has been done to death, with different manipulations to control for different things, and it has even been done with statistical experts, i.e. grad students, statisticians, etc, to no (or very little) avail: the conjunction effect remains. And people have had all sorts of explanations for this, the most popular one being that option 2 was more "representative" of Linda than option 1, hence it seems more likely to us. To take it a step further, the fathers of this experiment, Kahneman &amp; Tversky, postulated two systems of human reasoning. System 1 is fast and imprecise, and uses "heuristics" to make quick judgements in the real-world, and system 2 is more logical and follows formal mathematical steps. I'm not really doing it justice, neither am I trying to, go read Wikipedia if you're interested. My personal opinion is that a psychological theory already has limited credibility if it's supported only by behavioral experiments, but I'm just a grad student and this guy has a Nobel Prize in Economics, so what the hell do I know? In any case, this phenomenon is probably real, it just depends on how you explain it.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My experiment, though, was not to reproduce the findings in a modern world. As much as I would have liked to coast on the assignment, this class actually has a letter grade. No, I had a hypothesis that unfortunately took all week for me to conjure up, and it was this:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What if you inserted a third statement, one that was a lot closer in probability to the constituent (option 1). Would the difficulty in ranking those two options then jumpstart your system 2, which then carries over to your judgement of the conjunction option? In other words, your system 1 (heuristics) operates in a large scale regime, and is only able to make decisions up to a certain limited resolution. If you have two choices that appear too similar heuristically, you might be forced to activate your formal statistical system, which really separates fine-grained things. It's like comparing whether or not you want to eat out, and whether you want to eat pizza or burgers for lunch, and the latter is SO MUCH HARDER. In comparison, an unrelated statement, or one that was much farther away in probability, would not result in activation of your system 2. I drew a nice little picture to outline this:</p>

      <img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/5451f209e4b04057136b5eb0/1414656522347//img.jpg" alt=""/>


<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I like how the red squiggly lines are so bait. Yeah I screenshot this from Word, sue me. Go read the PDF if you're not here for the humor. Carrying on, so the prediction would be, in the experimental condition (the close condition), people would display less conjunction fallacy, since system 2 was activated and carried over. Conversely, people in the control condition (the far condition) would do worse, because it was so easy to rank the additional statement that no extra thought was given. So I retrofitted the problem (Linda is now a consultant rather than a banker because times are hard and girls gotta get paid), and added an additional, different, option. The control option was "Linda graduated from college/university", which she obviously did, because she majored in philosophy. Luckily, most of you got this. The experimental option was "Linda is a consultant and works more than 40 hours a week." Confession time: I had originally intended the experimental option to be MUCH closer in likelihood to the constituent (Linda is a consultant), because I thought it was common knowledge that consultants work 50-60 hours minimum. That's actually why I put MANAGEMENT consultant, because they're usually the crazy people. But apparently this was NOT common knowledge, probably because not everyone that answered tried applying for a consulting job. I digress. Luckily, this additional one ended up being much closer to the conjunction option, i.e. 50% of the people ranked "Linda is consultant and works more than 40 hours" higher in likelihood than "Linda is consultant and activist", and vice versa. Go to end of the <a href="/s/Assignment1.pdf">PDF</a> to see the full ranking tally.</p><p>Well, what was the main finding?</p><p>*Drum roll*</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What are the 3 bars? They represent the percentage of people that correctly ranked the constituent to be more likely than the conjunction, i.e. P(Linda is consultant) &gt; P(Linda is consultant AND something else). How these were calculated was basically, ignoring the third option, to see if the constituent was ranked higher than the conjunction. And in the case of the experimental condition, there were two conjunction options, hence two blue bars.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The red bar is the result from the control condition, where the "something else" is "activist". The middle blue bar is the same "something else" but in the experimental condition, and this is really where the money is at. Remember that the hypothesis was that people exposed to the more difficult (closer) choices would use their system 2 and thus do better on this task? Well they did, by a whooping 6%. I'll be honest with you, I don't even know how to put error bars on a statistic like this, what's my measurement error? What's my variance if I had one trial. lol. No, you don't need to remind me how shoddy this science is, though I'd be happy to hear about it, because I may or may not make such mistakes on actual science, whenever it is that I get to do that. Besides, blame yourselves for not participating enough, I COULD have had statistical significance. In any case, whereas any normal person sees this and says "this really doesn't seem like anything", I will go the scientist way and say, "this preliminary result warrants further investigation, preferably with money for fancy brain technology." The one good thing was that, at least the exact same percentage ranked the OTHER conjunction as more likely, so it counts as like a second trial, if you squint a little.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The takeaway? Half of you suck at statistics. Either that, or you knew what I was looking for and cooperated (subconsciously, which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_characteristics">real thing</a>), in which case, d'awww :'). Okay really though, don't feel bad if you got it wrong, this is just how you evolved to adapt to the environment around you. If you made the statistically correct choice all the time, yeah your life would be more "correct", but you'd spend 200% more time doing literally any little thing. This is where the 80-20 rule comes in, otherwise known as "fuck it I'll just wing it". The best part of this is what some of you wrote for the justification, because it's scary how well some people justified their wrong answer, like it almost makes you feel stupid for thinking statistically. Full data set is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1B5T_UfqXe9MrXci45Vh3k8JgKnaFHwnrLTWHvnB5zGE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> if anybody's interested. Also it was funny because even though the responses are anonymous, I could pretty much tell who's writing what, especially things like "too lazy".</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Once again, a big thank you to everyone that participated and contributed meaningfully. As much as I thought this to be a pointless waste of time, it was fun to engage people I know in this shoddy science, which by the way is NOT what I do professionally. So hopefully the next time one of you gets involved with my experiments, it will be some really cool shit, or maybe I'll just need to borrow your brain, or something. As always, comments and suggestions are very welcome, about the writing or the science, or if you just have beef with experimental psychology, then we can have a drink and complain all about it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Who came first: the chicken or the egg?</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/25/who-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Is similarity the basis of categorization? Or does categorization inevitably lead to similarity? Will we ever know? Is this even a good question? In addressing this century-old psychology question, I will first go over the four readings of this week, summarizing their relevant contributions to this discussions. Then, in the second half, I will attempt to define what I think categories and features are, and what kind of problems my definitions will face. In short, I agree with the fuzzy and theory-driven model of concept formation, though my version is a bit more extreme than that presented by Medin. You can go to middle of page 2 to skip the summaries.</span></p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Tversky and Tenenbaum</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp; We begin with Tversky’s proposal of the set-theoretic approach to similarity. In response to the classical geometric model of similarity, Tversky shows that its three assumptions – minimality, symmetry, and triangle inequality – do not hold well in an array of scenarios. Instead, he proposes a more general theory of feature membership, in an attempt to align with the empirically observed data. In a nutshell, Tversky’s theory not only considers the intersecting features of two objects, but also the difference of features, in both directions, and by adjusting the weights on each of the three functions, he shows reliable prediction of behavioral data. Furthermore, he gives consideration to some of the observed human nuances, such as diagnosticity and what makes a good metaphor. Overall, Tversky’s theory is a fair one in trying to move away from the rather rigid geometric model, as the free parameters do a great job in capturing situations such as when humans consider context. Unfortunately, because the theory is so general in attempting to capture very abstract processes, all the while being mathematically “defined”, it seems rather empty on the inside: the harder he tries to prove the theory with experimental data, the more contrived it feels.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tenenbaum &amp; Griffiths, on the other hand, commits to being (largely) a mathematical discussion. While Tenenbaum also provides examples of application, he doesn’t claim that the human brain IS doing any kind of Bayesian analysis. The paper presents a Bayesian model of generalization, and extends it to multiple prior observations. It’s also shown that the model can deal with arbitrary (non-continuous) stimulus structures, and is in fact quite similar to the set-theoretic model. In the end, Tenenbaum concedes by saying that we have very little clue regarding the origin of the priors, but the model remains useful nonetheless, given good estimates of priors. Here, the magic broom of unknown priors cunningly save the theory from unnecessary conjectures about the wide range of human behaviors, and limits its narrow, but useful applicability.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Medin and Rosch</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Medin and Rosch papers were much more palatable, perhaps because they a) were more general reviews, and b) shunned away from any mathematical formalization. Rosch breaks open the discussion by renouncing the classical theory of well-defined sets, and introduces the fuzzy and graded features. She provides a list of evidence why graded features are more natural for humans, and coins the term conceptual prototype, which can take on various forms, such as an average example of class membership, or an extreme, or just some discrete prior instances. She then handles some of the criticism of the model, as well as problems involving operations with fuzzy features. Smartly, she stays away from the mathematically defined “fuzzy-logic”.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Finally, Rosch nicely summarizes the different perspectives of the classical category view and the probabilistic (fuzzy) view. As a proponent of the fuzzy model, he tackles some of the issues facing prototypical versus exemplar representations. Finally, in the discussion that I found to be the most reasonable and insightful, he raises the question of just what exactly concepts and features are, and how their intricate relationship complicates our pursuit of a generalized theory of categorization. Hence, this is where I will begin my discussion.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>The Category of Features</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that the definition of what a feature is should be a very important concept to settle on, but instead, the older literature have skimmed over it rather haphazardly, going for the easy and intuitive ones, like color or some visible physical property. It’s only discussed later on that goal-driven features are also possible, such as “things to eat while dieting”. We can easily extrapolate that further: in fact, the (degree of) satisfaction of any arbitrary criteria can be deemed to be a feature. Medin briefly discussed the way people use features of different depth to describe drawings, though the possibility is not only deep, but broad. I really want to emphasize this point, that any information-bearing construct can be used as a feature, because it should then be obvious that humans don’t have an intrinsic set of features for any category. Sure, there are common ones, ones we can easily draw into our consciousness, such as “redness” and “sweetness” for the category of apples, but we also have the remarkable ability to judge one’s ownership of spontaneous, arbitrary, and even senseless features (think happiness of a fork). What, then, enables us to make that judgement after the fact of having categorized a certain object?</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Features of a Category</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, what constitutes as a category? In the most general sense, a category is an abstraction, a projection from an infinite-dimensional space onto a lower, and more importantly, relevant dimensional-space. It’s ironic that our excellence at generalizing is exactly what’s hindering the study of generalization: because if we can find a dimension onto which humans are incapable of projecting, then we’ve reached some sort of hardware limit, which we can use as the basis, or atomic unit, of the cognitive process of generalization. Just to exemplify how much we generalize: why do we think a physical object is constant across time? Really, every infinitesimal time step should produce an instantiation of the object-category, instead of “being” the object itself. For example, the apple I’m holding is not the same apple as it was half a second ago, and it will be different from what it will be half a second later. Of course, this is rather extreme and thinking about it this way serves little practical use, but the point is that we do this so implicitly that maybe categorization, in its most basic form, occurs on a subconscious level, for which the conscious mind simply rationalizes about. The school children drawing study in Medin is a great example, because rather than “learning” about the features of a particular category (farm vs. city, etc), people just latch onto the differentiating features and rationalize it after the fact.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>It’s a Formless Cloud of Relations</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I’ve posited that categories and features can be anything and everything, what next? Well, instead of the categories being vertices and the features being lattices in a connective framework, which is how we typically think about them, they should really be equivalent forms of entities. After all, “red” is as much of a concept as “apple” is, and both are members of each other. A great line in Medin: “properties in general are not independent but rather are linked by a variety of interproperty relations.” But instead of properties, it’s really all things. Is it possible to know what an object (let’s call it A) is, without knowing what not-A is? Hence, an object shouldn’t really have anything to call its “own”, but rather, it is defined by its relationship with other objects. In short, I agree more with what the theory-driven model has to say about categorization, at least in principle. But I’m uncertain whether such a conscious process like theory-forming should be used as the basis for a behaviour that is much more pervasive.</p><p style="text-align:justify"><strong>For The Sake of Science </strong></p><p style="text-align:justify"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I may have arrived at a spiritually satisfying answer regarding what categories and features are, but it suffers from the same flaws that, in my opinion, plagues Tversky’s paper, which is that it’s too general and all-encompassing, but useless in the context of studying cognition without further constraints. I won’t even begin to formalize a definition of similarity from my definition of categories, so let me conclude with some possible constraints. First, (human) cognition seems to be intimately intertwined with perception, such that representation occurs even in the lowest neural circuits (directional preference in retinal neurons, texture sensitivity in finger tips, etc). This implies that there could be a lower end in the spectrum of abstraction, i.e. we can’t really describe some fundamental things, like what red is, aside from that it’s not green or yellow. Second, there is an upper bound to the number of objects we can represent, because there is a finite number of cells and connections in our brains. For all practical purposes, this number is so big that it is infinity, but it isn’t quite. This means that, while we can theoretically have an infinite number of relationships between objects, we’re constrained by our biological system, and one day, we may finally be able to do accounting on all the relationships that exist between mental representations of objects. And lastly (not because it’s actually the last, but this paper has to end somewhere), the process of acquiring new representations, or, learning, is a physical phenomenon occurring in the molecules and cells inside our brains. This last constraint will perhaps be the saving grace of the study of categories, as it enables us to say (more) definitively how concepts and relationships are stored in the brain. Obviously, seeing how the constraints are all biological in nature, this discussion is full of the biases of a neuroscience student, but I do believe that uncovering the mechanisms of our behaviour is a leg up from just characterizing the input-output responses of the blackbox that is the human brain.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>It's Getting Hot In Here</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/5/26/fl5oehwotmkpto9eiqfgwwsyau778a</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I hate hot weather. I hate it so much more than I hate when it's cold, because even though I feel like the Michelin Man, being in the cold means that I can always put on another layer. And if I really think about it, the reason why I hate the cold is because when I'm warm enough to be comfortable outside, I'll be burning hot inside. Don't get me wrong, I love a sunny day just as much as the next guy. But forget about the raging infernos and the pits of fire, being in a room that's 28+ Celsius with zero draft is pretty much hell for me. The worst thing about the heat is not the physical discomfort, but rather, it's the apparently debilitating effect it has on my cognitive functions, which lead me to ask: what exactly it is about the heat that fucks up my day?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I can understand how general physical discomfort can piss off the brain enough till it stop functioning. But instead of lumping this cause &amp; effect, we can be a bit more scientific about it and focus on the heat for the moment, and consider a few explanations that are as orthogonal as possible. As always, I assume that I'm not some alien life form on Earth and that other people experience similar distaste for this suffocating heat.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Broadly speaking, we can look at how the heat gets to your head in two ways: direct vs. indirect. By direct mechanism I am referring to the temperature dependence of neurons and cell function in general, which should be rather straightforward to study, such as the ionic equilibrium potential, governed by the Nernst equation. There is probably a very fine temperature range, outside of which abnormal cell states begin to manifest. However, this will most likely turn out to have a minute effect, since the human body is so adept at regulating its internal temperature. It should be noted here that this is assuming that I am capable of normal thermoregulation, since in pathological situations such as a high fever, even a few degrees can cause permanent brain damage [1]. Interestingly, nerve conduction speed, which I will take as a first order approximation for regular cognitive processes, sees an increase proportional to temperature [2]. This means that to some degree, you might actually be smarter and/or faster when it gets hot! Not really, but the point of all of this is that this level of heat (&lt; 40C) probably won't affect your neurons all that much, and for the amount of heat that does get through, it won't actually make you stupid on a cellular level.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Scratch that, [3] shows overall increased cognitive performance with slightly increased body temperature, controlling for factors such as circadian rhythm, hours awake, etc. I haven't gone into the details too much, one of my biggest question being the effectiveness of their attempt to control for sleep. But this is really starting to hurt my case either way.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The other possibility, then, is by ways of an indirect mechanism, perhaps a side effect of the regular thermoregulation process. Speaking from my own experience, aside from being incredibly slow, two of the more prevalent effects of a hot day are irritability and lack of motivation, i.e. I become a crank couch potato. A quick scan at literature reveals that this exact effect has indeed been shown: [4] notes self-reported increase in irritability and decrease in alertness, but curiously, also improved speeds at math calculation and verbal reasoning, with a 2 degree Celsius increase in body temperature; [5] notes increased preference for aggression-type activity, although this one comes with a huge caveat, and frankly the experiment design itself is pretty hilarious, so give that a read. Finally, [6] summarizes a few other studies, looking at a positive correlation between warm temperature and mood, suicide, and violent crimes.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; All in all, what I've managed to learn through this little excursion is that 1) people hate hot and humid temperatures, 2) cognitive performance does not actually suffer with increased temperature, and 3) this needs more research to draw conclusive findings. In essence, it's all in my head. A few notes to consider, however: first, the cognitive tasks performed in the studies are usually straightforward and mechanical, i.e. calculations and reading comprehension. This limits the proficiency findings to only a subset of tasks, and not others, such as more open tasks like writing (I know I had a lot of trouble finishing up this piece in this suddenly &gt;25 C weather). Second, motivation was essentially a non-issue in these tasks, because it isn't really up to the participants to push themselves to do the task, unlike in real-life situations at home or work. Third, I really need to get AC in the house. Finally, although I didn't find a satisfactory answer, we can venture a guess as to why both the laziness and the irritability come about: due to the already high ambient temperature, the body probably wants no part in extra movements that will generate even more body heat, thus reducing me to a potato; and as for irritability, it might be a product of all the pent up energy the body doesn't need to use for heating anymore.</p><p>Basically, I'm too hot to move, but already hot enough to be pissed.</p><p class="text-align-center"><span style="font-size:14px">_____</span></p><p>My citation formatting is really going out the window.

      <title>27/52: Some notes from SfN2018</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/11/21/2752-some-notes-from-sfn2018</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some background for my non-neuroscience friends: the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) is a huge academic conference, drawing 30000+ attendees and 10000+ poster and podium presentations, all under the gigantic umbrella of "neuroscience". For scale, the Air Canada center seats about 18000 people, so imagine more than half of the people in a packed Raptors game giving presentations over the span of 4 and a half days. At a lack of better words, it is a zoo. This year, it was held at the conference center in Washington, DC. Since I actually jotted down some detailed notes, both about the science itself as well as some feelings and/or random musings I had while walking 20000 steps through the poster hall every day, I figured I'll share them here.</p>

       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="2500.0"]<img src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73/535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd/5a13df468165f5db96dcda5d/1511251797503/IMG_8686.JPG" alt="This is about 1/8 of the poster floor, which was completely filled during this 4-hour presentation block, of which there were 9."/> This is about 1/8 of the poster floor, which was completely filled during this 4-hour presentation block, of which there were 9.[/caption]


<hr /><ul><li>The posters are organized by subfields, so if your poster is about neuronal morphology, it will be physically close to those of similar nature, and probably in the same poster session. How do subfields get organized then? My hypothesis is that they are placed across the poster hall such that people that are the least likely to interact are placed as far apart as possible. This makes a lot of sense, which usually means pure biology at very detailed levels are on the opposite end of pure mathematical modeling, but there definitely DO exist people that create detailed models of neuronal morphology, for example.&nbsp; So for me, it has never been more painful, literally, to work at the intersection of cellular neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, and computational modeling, because those 3 subfields literally spanned the entirety of the poster hall, which is about 400 meters in width here. Honestly, if sending an email to a potential collaborator in another subfield doesn't stop you from interdisciplinary collaboration, this walk probably will...</li><li>Related to the layout, literally every person I've talked to had made this complaint: most of the posters I really want to see are in the same presentation time block as me. Again, this makes sense, because the most similar topics are grouped into the same group, but that means everything that's relevant to my work I will not be able to see. So what's the happy middle ground here? We obviously don't want to scatter similar things so far apart that it's incoherent, but the other extreme, which is placing all the similar things in a single session, doesn't make sense either, because then you're not presenting to the people that actually care about your work. I wonder if SfN has some kind of algorithmic decision process for poster placement. Yes, I am aware that we have a 1-hour assigned slot to present, but let's be real, nobody leaves their poster outside of that one hour to go see other people's posters, because god forbid that someone with helpful comments will come by and you're not there. What did help was to have a lab mate there to take over for me while I raced around my section quickly to see what I had planned to see.</li></ul><hr /><p>- i feel stressed by all the things going on at sfn as a graduate student, because everyone is doing cool stuff and many of them similar to what im doing. but stepping back, as a person interested in neural sciences, it’s really cool to see SO many different kinds of work converging in the same place, spanning from detailed biology to purely behavioral work</p><p>- start to develop an attention to details: specific behavior, specific brain area, specific timeline, etc. things that probably don’t matter in theory but very much so in practice, especially methodological details in experimental settings</p><p>- multi-level paradigm as the bread and butter: integrating multiple levels of investigations, specifically, including spikes, field potentials, and computational theory with behavior</p><p>- i have a TERRIBLE elevator pitch, especially for scientists that are kinda familiar with comp neuro and methods, but not the exact phenomenon i’m working on</p><p>- symposium style presentation (usually PI-level talks): start with a anecdotal story or something mundane and everyday, and move into introduction, then a regular science talk. nano-symposiums act more like data dumps, which skip the first framing part because people are usually aware of the context</p><p>- constructive skepticism: recognize everything that could be “bad” in a study, and think of ways to improve upon it</p><p>- the most valuable activities at sfn: socialize (both schmooze and catching up), talk to people at their posters, get feedback on my own poster, and quickly learn the history and state of the art in an unfamiliar field</p><p>- people often reason about neural computation using very intuitive arguments, like representational capacity of a network</p><p>- people enjoy when their work is read, more so when it’s received positively (duh).</p>]]></content:encoded>

One of them asks the other: "what did you think of the film?" The other replies: "ah, James Franco's performance was simply electrifying, wouldn't you agree!" The first nods in agreement: "electrifying, indeed. I do wonder how he and Seth Rogen still manage to have the spark after all these years."</p><p>Next day in the lab, the two physicists begin their investigation of the electron transfer properties between James Franco and Seth Rogen.</p><hr /><p>The goal of modern neuroscience, especially that of cognitive neuroscience, is to characterize the biological basis of behavior and cognition. Meaning, how does the (central, mostly) nervous system enable the various operations of behaving organisms. A concrete question, for example, is "how do our brains store the telephone number we're trying to hold in memory while being bombarded with constant sensory input?" These are the kinds of questions that neuroscientists are working towards on a daily basis today.</p>

<p>It used to be the case, not long ago, that "neural mechanisms" was the term of choice, as you can see for the first half of the 20th century from the above Google n-gram search. Since the mid 90s, however, it seems that we have begun to acknowledge the shaky philosophical ground on which we stand by assuming that what goes on in the nervous system <strong>causes</strong>&nbsp;behavior, and so we effectively punt on this point by switching over to the term "neural correlates" (though note that neural basis steadily rises since the 30s). Being agnostic to whether the brain actually "causes" or only "mirrors" behavior and cognition is not a big problem, as it still enables us to conduct scientific experiments, and it is an essential part of understanding how we (humans) do what we do.</p><p>Having legitimized "neural correlate" as a productive line of investigation, for better or worse, we can now focus on finding ever-improving snapshots of such neural correlates. Practically, that means we want to know exactly when and where the brain does something in parallel with when a person or animal does X, Y, or Z, and for that reason, neuroscience in the last few decades has been developing better and better tools and analytical techniques to better understand the brain tissue itself - things like connectivity and functional imaging, as well as causal neural circuit manipulation. Some refer to this trend as "neuro-chauvinism", as the neural and cellular half of the investigation has been given a disproportionate amount of focus, and more importantly, funding resources. Maybe this is because very few of us ever actually see a brain or a brain cell, whereas all of us experience behavior in ourselves and others,&nbsp;that we think the fatty blob to be more mysterious. Or perhaps it spawns from the reductionist philosophy that understanding these biological "atoms" - interconnected neural circuits - will necessarily lead to our understanding of the whole: psychology reduces to biology, biology to chemistry, and chemistry to physics, and we have some goddamn good math for physics, so as long as we can mathematicize the underlying neurobiology like we continue to do in characterizing the physical world around us,&nbsp;then everything from consciousness to intelligence will be satisfactorily explained.</p><p><strong>We're not brains in vats?</strong></p><p>I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I've held that view for a long time. Surprising, I know. But I have to say, having been drinking the cognitive science kool-aid for the last 3 years, I'm a little more convinced that maybe spending time and funding resources on that second half of the "neural correlate of XYZ" is very important as well: namely, detailing the behaviors X, Y, and Z. This does not mean they are mutually exclusive, but there is only so much research dollars to go around in reality. I won't bore you with the details, but it turns out if you spend enough time with people who care a lot about human and animal behaviors, some of that will rub off on you. This newfound appreciation coincides with, and is also inspired by,&nbsp;a recent resurgence of neuroscientists championing more in-depth characterization of "behaviors" in studying the brain, which is nicely summarized and argued for in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28182904">Krakauer et al., 2017</a>.</p><p>I highly recommend giving that paper a read if you're at all interested in what neuroscience is trying to accomplish, as it is very accessible to a lay audience, but the main argument boils down to this: understanding the neural basis of behavior requires that we understand, to some extent, both the nervous system and natural behaviors.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a new view, as it has been detailed previously by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinbergen%27s_four_questions">Tinbergen</a>,&nbsp;and the entire fields of&nbsp; behavioral psychology and later, embodied cognition, though I now realize that those might not come in the vanilla neuroscience graduate curriculum. Those nights of slaving away on 80-page papers are finally justified.</p><p>By "understanding",&nbsp;I roughly mean that we can construct a data-driven model of how various elements relate to each other and the whole, like mapping out a relational structure, or otherwise known as an ontology. I'm sure I'm butchering the formal definition of the word, but a dictionary, for example, maps out the ontology of words: how words are defined by other words, which are in turn defined by networks of yet more words. A neuro-ontology, then, might exist at the level of brain lobes, or cell types based on morphology or gene expression, or both. Once we have good relational structures mapped out of the brain and of natural behaviors independently, we could then start to bridge the gap between the two by finding consistent correlates. The problem is, as those authors argue in the above paper, that we currently have a poor understanding of behavior and neuroscience is not doing much to improve that. Without behavior, modern neuroscience essentially reduces to fiddling with really cool toys. Another point they stress is studying "natural behavior": sure, it is interesting to know that activating a certain subpopulation of neurons will make you hallucinate a purple elephant riding a rainbow (nyancat style), but is that ever an observed behavior in the wild, and to what extent do we care about it if it is not?</p>

<p><strong>Turns out, our natural behavior is not sitting in front of a screen for hours on end so that we can be rewarded with drops of suspicious liquid...wait, it's not?</strong></p><p>So how is behavior studied in the typical neuroscience lab? Well, one word to describe it is "constrained", as it necessarily is in order for us to tightly control all other confounding variables a person (or animal) may experience outside of our variable of interest. I have a weirdly conflicting feeling about this paradigm: on the one hand, controlling for extraneous variables closely follows the tradition of physics, where only by isolating the single factor at play can we determine its relevance. On the other hand, those "extraneous" variables are what non-neuroscientists may refer to as being alive. Although, practically speaking, limiting degrees of freedom in the behavior we try to study is essential because our recording rigs look like these:&nbsp;</p><div class="image-gallery-wrapper">

</div><p>Just how limited are these lab behaviors? Conveniently enough, Surya Ganguli's group just uploaded their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/05/214262?%3Fcollection=">"task dimensionality" paper</a> (Gao et al., no relation) on bioRxiv this week, essentially making the case that the behaviors we study in the lab are so simple that it's no surprise that the corresponding neural measurements from just a few hundred neurons can almost fully capture any variation in those behaviors (which, by the way, is like a millionth of the total number of neurons we have). So for example, one might be interested in motor control, so one would train a monkey (or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/05/weird_psychology_social_science_researchers_rely_too_much_on_western_college.html">WEIRD</a> undergraduates) to perform a very specific reaching task constrained in 2D space, and voila, one would then find that a small group of neurons (or voxels) in the motor cortex could reliably predict arm trajectory (position, velocity, etc) up to a great degree of accuracy, even though that animal's natural range of movement in free behavior is much wider.&nbsp;</p><p>One might argue that, again, this was by design: the careful neurophysiologist does not rest UNTIL her experiment necessarily pinpoints a small number of neurons as responsible for a particular behavior. I don't remember where I heard this from, or how exactly it goes, but there is a quote that goes something like: "a good experiment is one where we do not need statistics to in analyzing the data". Probably spoken by a physicist. Holding back our collective physics-envy, though, I think systems neuroscience as a whole has started to move away from, or maybe exhausted the assumption that we can understand behavior as a whole by studying tiny piecewise chunks of it in the lab.</p><p><strong>Do we need a behavioral ontology?</strong></p><p>So where does that lead us? Well, a few recent papers have expanded on the idea of <strong>fully</strong> characterizing behavior prior to, or maybe even independent from, finding its neural correlate, and they rely on modern advances in machine learning and computer vision to automatically label behavioral categories - work that would otherwise take thousands of people-hours to perform. See <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277452">here</a> for a philosophical perspective on this methodology (computational ethology), and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28709004">here</a> for an absolute massive empirical study that basically solves Drosphilia behavior (aptly titled: <em>Mapping the Neural Substrates of Behavior</em>), and <a target="_blank" href="https://neuroecology.wordpress.com/2017/08/04/behavioral-quantification-mapping-the-neural-substrates-of-behavior/">here</a> for a nice and friendly exposition of the aforementioned study. To be perfectly clear, I don't at all mean to imply that there wasn't detailed and comprehensive behavioral work done prior to the last few years, as neuroscience has a history of doing just that, possibly stemming from its roots in behavioral psychology. All I'm trying to say is that I don't remember good behavioral work ever being "cool", and even more rare is it mentioned in the same sentence as other hot new things like "machine learning" and "big data", but then again, I haven't really been around for that long...</p>

<p> </p><p>As those researchers did with the fruitflies, we might try to do the same for humans: observe every single human behavior possible, unsupervised and unbiased, and then proceed to empirically separate them into discrete-ish categories, from which point we can go and look for their corresponding neural correlates confident in our knowledge of behavior. Let's assume, for a second, that this was feasible and also not ethnically questionable, would we arrive at similarly comprehensive findings as those above? I tend to think so, because I think humans are not qualitatively different from fruitflies, at least in the framework of ethology. Meaning, we might exhibit more complex (and just more) behaviors than fruitflies, but all of that can be explicitly captured just like that of flies, via visual, audio, and perhaps tactile recordings.&nbsp;At this point, you're probably thinking: "hoooooold tf up -&nbsp;humans are different from flies in a KEY way, and that's the ability to hold internal thoughts without explicit action." Alas, we are foiled! This means even if we were to record every single explicit action a person exhibits, we will still never be able to access those private thoughts, and thus our picture of "behavior" will necessarily be incomplete.</p><p>And that exact thought, after this long build up in the last few paragraphs, is the bone I want to pick today.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first started my PhD 3 years ago, I thought that the brain ultimately holds all the answers to our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, in that everything we "do" - consciously or subconsciously, explicitly or internally - had to have a corresponding neural cause, because ultimately it is our nervous system that enables us to do what we do. Over time, "cause" tampered into "correlate", but the idea remained: our cognition should have an exact counterpart, causal mechanism or simply a mirror image, in the brain. On the one hand, that seemed obvious: if our brains are ultimately the information processor and the action initiator, then any human act must be routed through the brain. On the other hand, that was an assumption, one that is implicit but fundamental to studying the brain, not just for me, but many others, I believe. After all, rarely do we ask the question of "is there a neural correlate of XYZ", but directly skip to "what IS the neural correlate of XYZ", and when we fail to find it, the paper does not get written, and we chalk it up to "not looking at the right place". In a sense, this assumption is an axiom, a fundamental and assumed truth,&nbsp;around which we are building modern neuroscience, and it has been incredibly successful, as we were able to find neural correlates of many, many behaviors and general cognitive "states", ranging from sensory perception, motor action, emotions, and even diseases.&nbsp;In the last few months, however, I've had several conversations that made me vaguely rethink this axiom of neuroscience, cumulating to this question: can we find the neural correlate of a backhand tennis stroke on grass vs. rubber courts?</p><p>A little context: I gave my end of year department talk summarizing my research over the last 3 years, and I framed it as, ultimately, an attempt to link neurobiology and behavior through intermediate, mesoscale neural signals (e.g. local field potentials).&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the last few months, however, I've had several conversations that made me rethink this axiom of neuroscience, and I will briefly recount two of such anecdotes below to illustrate how I've arrived at my current predicament.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Story 1. Functionalism: rocks as complex computational devices</strong><br />There is a prevalent metaphor among neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, which is that the brain is like a computer in that it receives, stores, and transforms information. What does that mean? To oversimplify quite a bit, our computers, for example, receives inputs (commands) from the user through the keyboard and mouse, interprets those commands within the current context (like traversing your web browser), and processes/transforms that information appropriately to make changes on the screen. The information throughout is encoded as bits - strings of 0s and 1s - represented by the voltages held by billions of tiny physical transistors in the CPU. In the "brain-is-computer" metaphor, information is encoded similarly by our biological brain, the difference simply being that bits are represented by the state of neurons (our wetware), instead of transistors. Within this framework ("<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)">functionalism</a>"), our brains perform functions similar to what a computer does (e.g. store memory, interpret visual/tactile inputs, etc.), just with different physical implementations. All that is fine and well, and this framing has led to tons of advances in neuroscience in the last few decades, partly due to the fact that we had really good mathematical tools to analyze and understand systems that manipulate and store information in this way. It is also intuitively appealing: consider, for example, the fact that both birds and planes fly, i.e. they perform the same function, just with different physical implementations. Fundamentally, this view sees objects (brains/computers, birds/planes) as implementations to effectively solve a particular computational problem (information processing, flying).</p><p>Taken to the extreme and away from the brain, however, this conversation almost always leads to the same ugly question every time I have it: are rocks sophisticated devices that computes a very difficult physics problem, namely, what is the trajectory a rock of given size and shape will go through when thrown with a given velocity and onto a given terrain? Consider another problem: let's say we are hammering a nail, and a (bored) physicist may sit down one afternoon and work out the precise velocity the hammerhead travels at given the force one applies to it. It's not a terribly difficult problem, but non-trivial and will require at least high-school level physics. But is it possible that something else could compute the hammer's velocity much faster? This is precisely what I came across one day, scrolling through Twitter:</p>

   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does the nail compute hammer's speed and encode it in its depth in the wall? And if not, why not?</p>— Romain Brette (@RomainBrette) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainBrette/status/879584542213976065">June 27, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Indeed, does the nail serve as a computational device that instantaneously works out the velocity of a hammer and encodes it as its own depth in the wall? And if it does, doesn't that mean that the rock, too, computes sophisticated physics problems, and basically every object in this world can and does serve as some (incredibly niche) computational device?</p><p> </p><p>- many concepts are social constructs that we may or may not find neural correlates for</p><p>- functionalism</p><p>- internal (intentional) variables vs. external (objective/measurable?) variables?</p><p>- movement vs. social disorder</p><p>- fuzzy spectrum</p><p>- similar to gene interactions</p><p>- so neurodynamics is a set of lego blocks that can be used to build and “represent” different things, possibly with the same set of blocks (underdetermined)</p><p>- to say there is a neural correlate of everything is to say each individual brain at any given moment is unique, which means neuroscience is hopeless</p><p>- pragmatically, we can settle on some midpoint: finding the minimal set that explains the maximal variance in “cognition"</p><p>- what kinds of behaviors/cognitive states ARE most consistently represented? are they more relevant for one reason or another?</p><p>- we probably need to define some terms better, quantitatively&nbsp;</p><p>- move from “receptive fields” to “feature detectors” - interpreter independent to dependent</p><p>- requires abstractions/inductive reasoning: time &amp; space invariance, individual invariance? baggage from physics</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Don't be an asshole - on being a student and teacher in higher education</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/12/26/dont-be-an-asshole-on-being-a-student-and-teacher-in-higher-education</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've just finished being a teaching assistant for the 5th time, and being on the other side for this long made me realize a few things that I had not appreciated when I was an undergraduate - or highschool, even - student. The 5 classes were wildly different, from intro to engineering design when I myself was still an undergrad (Praxis, probably the most notoriously arbitrary EngSci class), to a 30-person advanced machine learning class where the best kids could go toe-to-toe with me, to this quarter, where I TAed for a 500-person intro to cognitive science class where the experience felt more like herding stray sheep than being a TA at a world renowned university. &nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>I have just finished being a teaching assistant for the 5th time now, once during my own undergrad, and 4 times as a grad student. My physical, intellectual, and emotional involvement have been wildly different for these 5 classes due to their different requirements. Because of that, I feel like I have now experienced a wide enough range of situations that I can gather up a memoir of experiences, both for myself in the future as an instructor, as well as for any unsuspecting, green-eyed undergraduate students out there.&nbsp;While being a TA is obviously not the same as being a full-blown professor teaching the class, it does offer you some rare insights on the main product of the whole higher education machinery - as well as small but rewarding joys and facepalm-inducing pains - that I wish I had accrued earlier, as a student, and as a TA.&nbsp;</p><p>The TLDR version, though, is as the title says: if you're a student, the key to doing well is basically to not be an asshole to your professor and TAs, whether you realize it or not, and to think just a little bit more. This might sound condescending, and might make me appear removed from the harsh lives of a struggling undergrad, but that's the point of this post - what I offer now are guarded secrets! (not really.)</p><p>These are, of course, my own experiences, and cannot be generalized to all TAs &amp; professors, nor do they prevent me from being sympathetic to the plight of everyday undergrads. Though, having been a grad student for 2 years now and in much closer contact with professors, I do believe this will be useful advice in most schools and majors.&nbsp;In fact, this is exactly the advice I wish I could give myself for when I was in undergrad. Hell, I just visited my high school last week and I realized this firmly applies there as well.</p><hr /><p>What does it mean to "not be an asshole?" Let's step back for a second. Starting from when I remembered things and actually learned shit in school, so say, since high school, I've always thought that teachers and the educational system are all pretty much figured out, and that everyone knows what they're doing and is just acting as cogs in the big machine. This means that courses were optimally designed, grading is done objectively, or as objectively as possible, and that teachers are impartial, even robotic, in their assessment of students' work. As a result, I thought I could just do the work to the best of my abilities and therefore be judged fairly based on what I did. Furthermore, this made me treat my professors and TAs as if they were robots, in that their one role, as far as I was concerned, was to relay material from their brain to mine. For me, everything was business-like, and every interaction was, to some degree, directly relevant to the course material. I rarely went to office hours because I worked really hard to figure it out on my own, and because I didn't think TAs were there to babysit me. Luckily, because I was in engineering, and most things were objectively right or wrong, I don't think I suffered any negative consequences for this, at least not as a student.</p><p>What never occurred to me, until this past year really, is that teachers, professors, and TAs alike, are all human beings.</p><p>I'll just talk about the two classes I TAed for in the last 12 months, because they were pretty much on the two ends of the spectrum of experiences. The first class was a 30-person, advanced undergrad machine learning class. The best kid in that class could probably (read: did) teach me a thing or two, especially given that my background was not in ML.&nbsp;I was probably assigned this class simply because I was okay at math in my department. The second class I TAed for was a 500-person, intro-level cognitive science class</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is yet another one of those days where I had plans to be productive for the night, but instead, I could only sit and stare blankly at my computer, knowing that I want to say something but not knowing what exactly I want to say. So I just sit, and stare. And at some point, I realize that some things are not meant to be written in a perfectly crafted way. I don't have a thesis, or an argument to present, just words I want to put down.</p><p>I am annoyed. I am annoyed that this blog that was originally meant for science and lighthearted musings has turned into consecutive reflections about tragedies in the world. I am annoyed that when I came here to find a draft I had written about another black man who needlessly lost his life to the police while selling a pack of cigarettes outside a convenience store almost a year ago today, I could not find it. I am more annoyed that that memory was so vivid that I even remembered that I had written a draft about that event. I am annoyed that I don't have it in me to even watch the video of yet another black man getting shot by a police officer while out on a drive with his girlfriend and kid. I am really annoyed, having seen the news about 4 police officers shot dead by two snipers in Dallas, that my first thought was, "I hope those guys can get away..."</p><p>I am annoyed that I don't have a better vocabulary of words, and that instead I will have to use sad, heartbroken, angry, and disgusted, yet again.</p><p>Kevin Durant joined the Warriors this week and I thought that would be the biggest thing that stirred up reactions on the internet. I'm annoyed that that wasn't -&nbsp;not by a long shot.</p><hr /><p>As I sat here blankly, I suddenly felt like I understood those politicians that could only offer their thoughts and prayers: thoughts and prayers are the only actionable outcomes when someone loses hope and the belief in that they can make a change. The reason for that hopelessness probably differs from person to person, though. For them, it's the impossible choice between lobbying money that supports their family and career, and their responsibility to their constituents. For us regular folks, it's probably more on the lines of just not knowing what the fuck we can do as individuals. I read a tweet that gave a very detailed outline of how to make sure your local politician prioritize police reform, like sending them an email. I read it, then I closed Twitter. I didn't send that email though.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People say books can be life changing. I don't read much for leisure anymore, and I certainly haven't had a life changing experience from reading a book. Sure, I've read books that were insightful and interesting, but life changing seemed like a stretch to me. That is, until I had finished reading The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat, by the late Oliver Sacks.&nbsp;Maybe life changing isn't the right term. It was revelatory. An experience like this has the curious effect of revealing about something about the world around you, but also the world within. I doubt other people will feel as special of a place for this book as I did, I guess that's how it taught me something about myself.</p><p>The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat is, quite simply, a collection of short essays by the late neurologist. My first inclination is to call it a casebook, as he describes the curious cases of a dozen or so of his past patients, suffering from a range of neurological disorders. But it couldn't be farther from the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>It made me realize something about myself. No, it made me remember something about myself. Maybe since I was 10, before I had ever heard of psychology, neuroscience, or cognition, I was intensely curious about why people were so damn unpredictable, and sometimes, insensible. Why, as a part of the physical world that we've been able to characterize to ever greater detail, have we not been able to get a grasp of why people do things the way they do, and think the way they think? To me, people should behave like math does: reasonably, and it was a source of great academic curiosity, but also of growing personal pain, that people didn't act reasonably and logically all the time.</p><p>As I grew older, I've (arguably) become better in my personal life at seeing people as more than robots in loose meat sacks, and that people's idiosyncrasies and deviation from predictability were all a part of who they are. Though this realization came gradually, and often, begrudgingly out of resignation. On the other hand, I was exposed to and became fascinated with the field of psychology - a whole academic discipline dedicated to discovering the patterns of human behavior! It was at least somewhat satisfactory to me, back then, that it seemed feasible to make generalizable claims about patterns of human behavior. Sure, the descriptions were often foggy and true in the statistical sense, but it was literally tying (sometimes) mathematical descriptions to human behavior. Imagine my joy. In fact, I was so interested in it that 3 out of my 4 college applications went out to Psychology programs.&nbsp;As I have said this to a few people before, it was only through a very fortuitous sequence of events, none of which was of my own volition (maybe other than the fact that I was good at math),&nbsp;that I ended up graduating as an engineer. I'm not being disparaging to Psych majors when I say that, I simply found out later on that 4 years of undergrad classes in psychology would not have been my cup of tea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p> </p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Most Important Thing You Will Read About Science Today</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/11/5/the-most-important-thing-you-will-read-about-science-today</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've gotten into several conversations recently about communicating science to people, probably because I'm taking a class called "Communicating Science", but also because (thankfully) the community around me actually cares about how to properly and effectively talk about our science to the public, the media, funding agencies, and of course, our grandmothers. At one point, I really thought that science communication is only necessary when your science sucks, and now, I'm beginning to believe that communicating science is just as important, and perhaps more so, than the science itself.&nbsp;</p><p>For most of my life, I believed that science is factual, it was about the truth of the universe and the truth only. And if someone were to discover a new fact about the world we live in, or about the biological machinery that is our own bodies, it should be deemed important. Well, being in graduate school for a year can change your outlook on many aspects of life, such as the necessity of solid foods and good hygiene. But most importantly, it really changed how I viewed science, and it was because of a fundamental, though seemingly trivial, realization: science needs an audience. Unless you're working in pure math or philosophy (in which case you'd probably be fine with not being read plus there's always the possibility of finding fame after you're dead), or if you've discovered the DNA,&nbsp;producing science requires you to communicate that science to somebody every single step of the way: you have an idea, you need to convince your advisor that it's not a stupid idea; you observe some cool results with great interpretations, you need to convince a journal to publish you; paper gets sent back, you need to convince your reviewers that you're not an idiot but you're not saying they're idiots either; you need money to feed yourself, you have to write that grant telling the foundations how great and important your science is. The point is that, you, as the scientist, can only do so much in shaping the final outcome of your work, the rest of the process involves other people's understanding of your work, and communicating effectively means raising the probability of you being heard and understood.</p><p>If you're in academia, all of the above should (hopefully) not be groundbreaking news. Whether you begrudgingly accept it or happily embrace it, the fact is, somebody else needs to understand what you're doing, and what implications your science has. Some people believe that scientists have a responsibility to communicate their work effectively, but I don't really like to think of it as a responsibility, it's more like a necessary skill, because, after all, communication is an integral skill that will effectively determine whether and how much you get paid.&nbsp;Maybe this depends on the specific field, because I'd imagine a physicist probably doesn't have to do as much convincing since, well, you found what you found and they can suck it if they don't like it. But in neuroscience, and health sciences in general, things are pretty vague right now (to say the least), and to be considered good science,&nbsp;most experiments require (1) an airtight interpretation, and (2) a potential to be impactful.</p><p>(1) is pretty simple, it comes from being a good scientist, or a good thinker in general. It's not necessarily EASY, but it's straightforward, and if you cover all your bases and do the necessary controls, it should be clear that the assumptions you're making are reasonable and lead directly to the interpretation you're making. Clear communication is obviously good here, but it really doesn't require too much fluff, though that's not to say people don't have problems with keeping things clear and concise.&nbsp;(2), however, is a trickier thing to navigate, and threading the needle between impactful and sensationalist is the topic of today's rant.</p><p>Deep down, most of us want our science to have an impact on the world, because that would be cool. But deeper down, we're often just super interested in a specific problem or a strange phenomenon in nature, and the impact of solving it is truly a secondary thought.&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Really, why do we have tenure?</p><p>This might be an extremely unpopular opinion given that I'm in an environment of current and future academics, and it could also serve to be one of those moments that bites you in the ass much later on, i.e. if I ever was in a position to be protected by tenure (academic-god willing). But seriously, what is the point of tenure?&nbsp;</p><p>This is not a rant, but an in-depth and historical analysis of tenure, with an conclusion that can be summarized succinctly in one sentence. In other words, TL;DR: great teachers won't need tenure, and we won't even realize the shitty teachers are gone.</p><p><strong>History</strong><br />Nice and easy: when the hell did this concept of tenure begin? For that, we refer to CLICK HERE a short Times article, which means, assuming you're out here looking to procrastinate by reading Trivial Pursuit facts instead of doing what you were actually suppose to, you should just go read it yourself.</p><p><strong>Possible Justifications</strong><br />research freedom (read: blank years. why would you keep someone around producing nothing? because they might possibly in the future? is this the only industry that doesn't give a fuck about who they sell to, only what they're selling? then why not stress over every single researcher, because they might always start producing at some point, right?)<br />unpopular research (what does that even mean? that global warming isn't a thing? racial discrimination isn't a thing? marijuana is not devil-lettuce?)<br />unpopular class content (this might be the only legit reason, if you gave enough of a shit to teach well-crafted but controversial lectures, which does not include "vaccination might cause autism here try some scented potpourri".&nbsp;<br />unpleasant person? (yeah but he's a great researcher so he has tenure? let's reward shitty interpersonal skills so we can further perpetuate the stereotypes that academics all look like Jamie Fox in the Amazing Spiderman.)<br />incapable teacher? (I had one such prof, great researcher, might be on route to curing heart diseases, terrible teacher, possibly skipped more lectures than I did (seriously), and you're telling me I'm paying fucking 10k a year because of the quality of education I will get here? WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING A NOBEL-PRIZE WINNER FOR A PROF IF SHE WON'T SHOW UP?)<br /> </p><p>University is a business. So why the hell do professors act like it's not? Oh because that's the only justification for academically awarded tenure. Why not keep great researchers in a research lab, and great teachers in a university, and if they happened to be great at both, golly, why don't we let them be at both? What's that you say? They might not have time? Gee, I sure hope my heart surgeon who's cross appointed in the med school is gonna have enough time to see his patients. Why the fuck would we expect our academics pure hearted and science-driven, while everyone else gets to chase money? Plus, even if that pipe dream is true, I'm pretty sure the smarter folks (those who realized that this professor job is a fucking gold mine) would have wormed their way in by now. Sure it's half or a quarter of the money you'll make a year as a CEO but how many CEOs are there that make 100k a year...EVERY YEAR TILL THEY CAN'T WALK ANYMORE? Why not pay your professors like you pay a programmer, or a market rep, or a sales rep, or fucking literally every other profession: pay them well when they do well, then fire them when they show up 3 years in a row producing no perceivable work, and leave it up to them to find a job whenever they feel like clocking in again?&nbsp;</p><p>Tenure denied: so wait, you're telling me this guy got rejected for tenure (read:fired) for non-research issues, but you would've happily had to keep him employed had he only been outrageous AFTER he got tenure? And if it was because he wasn't producing research, how do you know that he just wasn't ruminating on a low-key idea, you know, like you assume that he is HAD HE HAD TENURE?</p><p>The long and short of it, is that if you're worrying about getting fired as a professor, you'll probably do something about it. One is to be smarter, but I'd think that if you could just become smarter, you would've done it ages ago. Which only leaves you one other option,&nbsp;like, you know, to teach better. I have never, as a student, looked at a prof that was a great instructor with the feeling like...yeah but do they really deserve tenure for being a good teacher? I wonder if their research is up to par? Conversely, without fail, I will look up a terrible prof praying to my bank account that they're the next Stephen Hawking or Marie Curie because I seem to be paying to breathe their carbon dioxide, for which I would be willing to make a forty thousand dollar bet on, on the off chance that doing that might actually increase my IQ. But, without fail again, I find myself disappointed and think, fuck that guy and his shitty research. Next time UofT tries to convince you to go to that school, ask them for the average rating of a teaching professor, because you sure as hell won't be affected by their citation count, and you can't absorb Nobel-ness just by sleeping in that class. The ultimate solution, in my perspective, is still to separate church and state, I mean research and teaching. That might increase misaligned incentives for research? Uh, you mean there weren't irretrievably misaligned incentives right now, like doing enough to get government grants, whose leading monkeys shit lobbying money? Oh that's not too bad? What about patenting lab-created technology?&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Abusing Academic Jargons</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/9/22/abusing-academic-jargons</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a related note, part of the difficulty in talking about science is that I start to use jargons, not only when I talk about science, but I start to do this in everyday life. Honestly, I don't think I'm trying to be pompous, they are just so convenient and describe situations perfectly. Orthogonal, for example, is such a conveniently packaged word that can be applied to everyday problems, which describes two/or many aspects of a thing that can vary independently of each other, e.g. ISIS and the refugee crisis are not orthogonal issues.&nbsp;The literal meaning of "orthogonal" is "perpendicular", mathematically, which makes absolutely no sense in real life. It's probably closer to "independent" in regular-speak, though that word has its own connotations inherited from probabilities. Another word I abuse now is "projection", which, applied in regular life, basically means to ignore some aspects of a problem and focus on the dimensions that are tractable. Okay I think just abused "dimension". Anyway, the point is, academics come up with a lot of terms to precisely describe an abstract, well-defined situation. But one can often generalize real-life scenarios to </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>I go to the church of physics.</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/8/24/i-go-to-the-church-of-physics</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine Bobby. Bobby is the younger you (or for some, the current you) that first saw a rollercoaster on TV or in real life, and had no idea what that was. Wouldn't Bobby think to himself and say, "gee, that looks like they might die at any moment"? But somehow, Bobby overcame his fear and trusted in the person that told him -&nbsp;be it his parents, friends, or the ad guy on the radio -&nbsp;that even though the rattling death machines are twisting and turning at highway speeds topsy-turvy,&nbsp;everything will be alright?&nbsp;</p><p>Bobby threw himself into what is observably a deathtrap on the breath someone exhaled while saying those words, yet because of nothing but this belief, he somehow avoided being totally freaked out about his life, and even finds thrill and joy in the ride. For those of you that are thinking, "well Bobby obviously knows he won't die because of physics, duh!", go try convincing that friend you know, the one that acts like they got a restraining order on Canada's Wonderland, to try one of the rides because conservation of energy.</p><p>It is not a matter of understanding, but of belief. If you haven't figured out where I'm going with this, it's this:&nbsp;Bobby is us,&nbsp;that rollercoaster is life (literally metaphorically), the guarantor is [insert favorite omnipotent belief system, and we all have one], and science is, well, plain old science.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>/blog/2014/8/25/rgaoeu2014-bcn</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>You know the feeling you get when you almost doze off in class, but not quite? At which point, the most bizarre thoughts would materialize and you become imprisoned in an imaginary wonderland, feeling that things aren't quite right though you'd been reduced to a mere spectator, half conscious. If you had known just a bit more, you'd be able to reason your way out of this mess, or realize that you are in a mess in the first place. Fortunately (or not), something always jolts you awake, but in that split second of regaining consciousness, you're never certain whether you've re-entered the physical universe, or that you've finally become lucid in a world of your own rampant imagination.</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My window neighbor had decided to lift the cover, through which a violent streak of photons thrust me back into consciousness. I've always felt weirdly triumphant about crossing time zones on the plane, almost as if the sun had become subservient to the speed and elevation of the flying titanium tube I'm sitting in. My musing immediately turned into excitement, however, when I saw that we were descending towards civilization, neatly trimmed by an endless coast of ocean blue. I struck up a conversation with my aisle neighbor, adamant that I would not let this turn into a silent and awkward plane exit when everyone just sits there waiting like third-graders for the stewardess to tell us that it's now okay to get up - to prove that I was committed to change, damn it! It turned out to be awkward anyway, though, because after you bid each other a safe journey on a plane, everybody proceeds to walk the same kilometer between the plane and the custom.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I wasn't sure why I was in Barcelona. I mean, I knew why I was here: the cheapest plane ticket I found after two weeks of scavenging was one that flew into Barcelona...I guess that's reason enough. Honestly though, I didn't know much about it, other than a few friends vouching that it was their favorite city, and, of course, it being the home of FC Barcelona.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Project: PhotoOrganiser Pt.1</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/5/project-photoorganiser-pt1</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will have finally caught up on my weekly duties after this post (week 6?), even though I'm totally about to cheat and not write about anything.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; So the back story is that, after roughly 2 years of taking photos at an ungodly pace using my expansive array of photo-taking thingies, I now run into the problem of organizing and making sense of some-5000 photos. I started binning them manually into events, and although it's led me through quite the trip down memory lane, let's be honest here: ain't nobody got time for that. So, as any self-respecting (read: lazy) engineering graduate would do, I figured I could write some code for it. I could have done this whole thing -organization, analysis, and the whole 9 yard- in about 2 hours on MATLAB. But I've been meaning to, for the Nth time, pick up my Python for a while, so I figured it might be fun to learn it on the fly. After all, this agrees with my recent realization that I absolutely can't learn or remember anything without actually using it. Not that I was going to just read a Python book, but real life struggles beat example exercises any day.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, here it is: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rdgao/PhotoOrg">PhotoOrganizer</a>. It's really rather rudimentary right now, all it's doing is finding {jpg, bmp, png, etc} files in a folder and renaming them by their last-modified time (yyyy_mm_dd_hr_mi_se), which, conveniently enough for me, happens to be the time the photos are taken using my {iPod, GalaxyS3, Nexus7, camera}. No guarantees that it's the same for other devices though. Also,&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Review: Traditional Chinese Medicine in Science</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/5/17/review-traditional-chinese-medicine-in-science</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>What?</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; To what extend have the 1) efficacy and 2) mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine been reported in published scientific studies? &nbsp;</p><p><em>Why?</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This review is mainly the result of a conversation with my mom, who swears by how effective Chinese medicine is in treating body-wide and non-specific issues. The question is not whether it is effective, because I believe most Chinese people have had successful treatments (myself included), and a billion people in China receive it as the co-primary method of care. Also, my intuition tells me that a few thousand years of trial and error should have resulted in some useful conclusions that are passed down from generation to generation, which could very well be unfounded in the scientific sense. In fact, a few pharmacology breakthroughs in Western medicine every year are just that- stumbled upon, especially when it comes to treating psychological disorders [1]. The question is, rather, to what extend has the positive effects of traditional medicine been studied and explained. I'm going to lay out my disclaimer here that I wholeheartedly (and my mother too) believe in Western medicine, and in no way am I encouraging homeopathic treatments in place of scientifically proven medicine. I also don't claim any expertise in pharmacology, only drawing on my basic knowledge in biochemistry and electrophysiology to understand what I'm about to review. That being said, let's get the show on the road!</p><p><em>How?</em></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm going to limit my scope here to include only herbal medicine and acupuncture. Herbal medicine, probably like all pharmacological compounds, are extremely hard to study systematically. Not only is it hard to trace the exact mechanism of action through which it heals the body, my guess is that we don't even have any clue as to what the active ingredients are in a particular pot of black stew. But at the very least, we can see if there are any clinical studies with positive results. Similarly, I don't have much hope for finding a good explanation of acupuncture, but clinical studies will be satisfactory. In fact, that is how I will organize the review: <strong>a brief overview of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), reported clinical success, and finally, proposed mechanisms</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overview</strong> (aka a read-through of the Wikipedia article [2])</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Without going on too much of a tangent, I will summarize what I think is relevant:&nbsp;</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People used to joke about how black kids all aspire to become actors, athletes, or rappers. That's not so much a joke as it is a sad truth. Back then, every successful person of color represented in the media has been one of those 3 - they certainly were not Presidents, or any other regular profession for that matter. TV shows rarely showed black doctors or lawyers or even characters as protagonists.&nbsp;This has a pervasive, subtle, yet profound effect.</p><p>I grew up seeing successful Asians as computer scientists or accountants or some kind of general geeks, so nowadays when an Asian tells me they're studying to become a doctor or banker, I'm like yeah makes sense. But if an Asian was like "I want to run for office." I'd be like uh what, not even due to any conscious objection, just a vague feeling of weirdness - I've never seen that in my life.&nbsp;</p><p>Actors and athletes these days demand a tremendous amount of respect and exposure, but rappers -&nbsp;or hip-hop artists - were a representation of grass-root activism that resonated with the average working black man. Obviously you had to be hardworking, but you had to be also talented and lucky to be a Jamie Foxx or a Michael Jordan. But any brother down the block can practice the poetic craft and go to open mics, and speak to the world around them, as big or small as any individual's own world is. This gave people power, and more importantly, hope. Hip-hop was a way to both assert competitive dominance and demonstrate mutual cooperation and understanding - that I could slay you with words when we spar, but we walk hand in hand on issues that matter.&nbsp;</p><p>And then it became something else. When I started listening to popular rap music in the early 2000s, it was almost always about killing somebody, selling drugs, or both. Before that, sure, it showed up in places,&nbsp;as much as you'd expect, proportionally to how many people had to go through that life to make a living wage, but no more than that. Tupac would talk about life and struggles and personal stories, good and bad, for 11 songs, then drop something like hit em up for the 12th.&nbsp;But as the years went on, rap music became more and more stupid, and I mean that in a very literal sense - not artistically stupid, but stupid in its messages. It became about grillz and Jordans, getting turnt, and killing somebody (including cops) if they don't agree with you on anything. That was the most perplexing thing when I first started to listen to rap music: don't these records of people talking about selling coke and killing cops count as confessions? How the hell are they still walking around NOT in prison then?&nbsp;</p><p>Then I learned, it's just a saying. Sure, 50 Cent actually got shot like 10 times (probably), but rarely had someone talked about pulling up on somebody or sold drugs by the bricks and proceeded to do it. When Bobby Shmurda was in court, this guy was like "oh naw I was just playing." But the message is received by their listeners, loud and clear. And who are their listeners? Young black males that want to be successful and rich and provide for themselves and their family.</p><p>Sure, the odd white and Asian boy would get hit with the fever and feel some way about themselves back in the days (hahaha), but it was largely an outlier-like component of their lives: they knew it, their parents knew it, their friends and their friends' parents knew it. Plus I knew, if anything, I'm not black so I could never be successful as a rapper (shoutout to Jin and timothy delaghetto tho lol).&nbsp;So after indulging in a buffet of profanities once in a while, it was back to Sunday math classes. But for a lot more of black kids, this was what they can dream about when they want to aspire to be successful. No kid wants to shoot a cop for no fucking reason, but every kid wants to live the lifestyle that can afford you to buy anything you want. Obviously, I'm not saying every black kid in America wanted to be a gangsta rapper, but that was an overly represented lifestyle that trickled down into the ears and consciousness of the working class.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, shooting guns and selling drugs became irreversibly linked to successful rappers. But kids didn't know it was all an act, especially when you put a bunch of tween boys together in what's basically a dick measuring contest. They will compete to act the hardest, be the most dangerous, and hopefully along the way, become the most successful. For suburban kids in a healthy home and proper schools, it was maybe a fist fight or a good shoving, but in a housing complex where parents were off working two jobs just to get by, it was buying a gun or join some friends that have guns.&nbsp;</p><p>You know what was really striking to me? Eminem just started to get huge when I was fresh off the boat in Canada, and he was, to me, just another very successful rapper. I sorta knew it was weird that he was white, but he pretty much normalized me to the concept of non-black rappers. So it always stood out to me how he was just about on everyone's top 5 list, but almost NEVER rapped about pulling up on cops or sell drugs by the brick. Sure, he talked about strangling people or ending them in various other disgusting ways and sang about DOING drugs, but it was clearly a different set of unlawful behavior, something that doesn't warrant a cop shooting you in self defence.</p><p>And here we are today. We have been normalized to the image of the black male as gun-totting, drug-selling gangsters. Kids in a mixed race school knew that they were just guys in your class or on the same basketball team. But for places where interracial interactions are hard to come by, that's the peoples'&nbsp;concept of young black males. Meanwhile, rap music has got black kids killing themselves for shit they don't need, and resorting to violence because that's the way of conflict-resolution they are exposed to. They say music is a language with no barrier, but when one house party plays Mozart and another plays G-Unit, do their recipients hear the same thing?</p><p>I don't know the history of how this transpired, and I'm not that big of a conspiracy theorist to say that white people bought out artists by shaping the industry that way (not inconceivable though), so I will just say:&nbsp;this has got to stop. Someone might get their feelings hurt reading this thinking, well who are you to shit on black culture like this? To which I would say, hip-hop is black culture, lyrical activism is black culture, but violence and wearing pants at the knees are not black culture. How do I know? Everyone in the 50s and 60s were well-dressed, even at rallies and protests. It was just as cool for a black man to wear a nice suit as it was for a white man. But now, you're spending just as much on your outfit, except it's for Js on your feet. And until we start paying due respect to music with real messages and advices for our young - blacks and whites and Asians alike - the loudest voice in the room is the one calling for destruction, and police departments will continue to have the preemptive self-defence card to play.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This happens to me so much that it hurts, and I thought it might be an entertaining share:</p><p>A lot of times, I meet people through some activity that has a joint and non-social purpose, like playing basketball or being in a class together. This means that everyone is doing the same thing with roughly the same goal, like playing the game or learning, and it is in contrast to activities where the purpose is explicitly to socialize, like at a party or having dinner with friends.</p><p>Actually, that was not an accurate description: I don't really meet people.&nbsp;</p><p>What I mean to say is that, a lot of times,&nbsp;I partake in an activities where there are other people around me that are also partaking in the same activity. And because I'm a) usually focused on doing the activity itself, and b) an awkward person, I never end up introducing myself, nor do I ask other people for their names. This is fine most of the time, because I'll rarely interact with people that take the same class ever again, and different people come in and out for pick up basketball all the time. The problem is when the same people DO come up over and over again, either because I do the same thing at the same place over a long period of time, or if the setting is intimate and people interact heavily with each other, like a small class.</p><p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Thoughts on Books</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Top Shelf</strong></h1><p>These books here are literally on the top of my shelf, and I plan to read them at least more than once. They are here for one (or all) of the following reasons:<br />1)&nbsp;it's been life-changing and shaped the way I went about life , and I'd pretty much recommend it to everyone to at least flip through -&nbsp;it won't be a waste of time.<br />2) it deeply resonated with me on some personal level and made me understand myself a little better, and I'd <strong>strongly </strong>recommend it to someone who I feel similar to with regards to some personality trait, thoughts on a particular topic, or past life experiences.</p><p><strong>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</strong><br />Stephen Covey</p><p><strong>The Glass Bead Game</strong><br />Hermann Hess</p><p><strong>All the Light We Cannot See</strong><br />Anthony Doerr</p><hr /><h1><strong>Pretty Good</strong></h1><p>These books are either classics that I liked, or something I found at least pretty interesting/well-written. They're listed by the chronological order that I read them in (date of completion near the bottom of the notes). If something in the notes speaks to you, I recommend checking them out.</p><p>lalala</p><p><strong>1948</strong><br />George Orwell</p><p>a</p><p><strong>Just Mercy</strong><br />Bryan Stevenson</p><p><strong>How Did You Think of That</strong><br />David Killeffer</p><p>a<br /> </p><p><strong>When Breath Becomes Air</strong><br />Paul Kalanithi</p><p>a<br /> </p><p>a</p><p><strong>Flowers for Algernon</strong><br />Daniel Keyes</p><p>a</p><p><strong>Being Mortal</strong><br />Atul Gawande</p><hr /><h1><strong>Just Okay</strong></h1><p>I'd have to flip through them again to tell you what it was about...which is precisely the point of these notes, so I don't have to do that.</p>]]></content:encoded>
