      "diagram is that the input of each rat actually comes from a computer, not the\n",
      "preceding rat. This might not sound like a huge deal, but let's see how it is\n",
      "directly relevant to the \"Brainet for storage and retrieval of tactile\n",
      "memories\" experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, you have 3 rats in a chain, where rat 1 receives one of two\n",
      "patterns of electrical stimulation (call it A or B), and its brain responds in\n",
      "some manner, which is recorded at the output site (opposite S1) and the\n",
      "response causes stimulation of rat 2. The same thing repeats until rat 3,\n",
      "whose responds is then fed back to rat 1 to see if this \"memory\" is\n",
      "maintained. The cool way to do this would be, again, to route rat 1's response\n",
      "directly into rat 2, then from rat 2 to rat 3, then from rat 3 to rat 1, where\n",
      "we can see if the read-out pattern is similar to the pattern used to stimulate\n",
      "originally.\n",
      "\n",
      "What actually happens, though, is the following: rat 1 is stimulated on one\n",
      "side of the brain using pattern A, and response in its opposite S1 is\n",
      "recorded. Here, unless I'm GROSSLY mistaken, instead of routing this response\n",
      "to rat 2, it is processed in a computer, whereby the neural response of rat 1\n",
      "is decoded and the computer determines whether pattern A or B was used to\n",
      "stimulate. Then, based on what the computer thinks, that pattern, in its\n",
      "original form, is used to stimulate rat 2, and the same thing repeats. It's\n",
      "like playing broken telephone, but instead of each person passing on a\n",
      "distorted version of the message, there is a third person listening to you\n",
      "whispering your message to the next person down the table, and if the intruder\n",
      "was able to make out, say, 5 out of 10 words in the message, he would then\n",
      "give away the original untainted message instead to the next person in line.\n",
      "Now, it is still cool that the rat brain is able to differentially respond to\n",
      "the two stimuli (we will see how shortly), but it is not the rat-to-rat\n",
      "communication that is doing all the heavy lifting. Instead, the computer\n",
      "decoder is doing all the work: as long as it was able to reasonably guess the\n",
      "pattern, it effectively restores the message for the next rat. In my opinion,\n",
      "this kinda defeats the purpose of the brain-to-brain interface. In fact, it\n",
      "would accomplish the exact same thing by doing the message-passing procedure\n",
      "on the same rat 4 times. Sure, the probability of getting the message right\n",
      "still decreases as the chain length increases (0.5^n, where n is the number of\n",
      "rats), and it's impressive that the performance doesn't degrade dramatically.\n",
      "But by restoring the message every time it is decoded, it effectively\n",
      "nullifies the brain-brain communication between the rats, which is really the\n",
      "interesting thing here.\n",
