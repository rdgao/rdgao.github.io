This happens to me so much that it hurts, and I thought it might be an
entertaining share:

A lot of times, I meet people through some activity that has a joint and non-
social purpose, like playing basketball or being in a class together. This
means that everyone is doing the same thing with roughly the same goal, like
playing the game or learning, and it is in contrast to activities where the
purpose is explicitly to socialize, like at a party or having dinner with
friends.

Actually, that was not an accurate description: I don't really meet people.

What I mean to say is that, a lot of times, I partake in an activities where
there are other people around me that are also partaking in the same activity.
And because I'm a) usually focused on doing the activity itself, and b) an
awkward person, I never end up introducing myself, nor do I ask other people
for their names. This is fine most of the time, because I'll rarely interact
with people that take the same class ever again, and different people come in
and out for pick up basketball all the time. The problem is when the same
people DO come up over and over again, either because I do the same thing at
the same place over a long period of time, or if the setting is intimate and
people interact heavily with each other, like a small class.
