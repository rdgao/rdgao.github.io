There is a broccoli-shaped concrete spaceship in the dead center of the UCSD campus. Just kidding, it's actually the (Geisel) Library, named after Theodor Seuss Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss. In the first four and half years of my PhD, I've never stepped foot inside this library *a single time*. That turned out to be a mistake and an oversight that I've since fixed, because housed at the very bottom of this spaceship is the Teaching and Learning Commons and - the center of today's story - the Writing Hub.

As it says in the header, the UCSD Writing Hub runs writing workshops and provides one-on-one consultations to undergraduate and graduate students across the campus. For the last year and a bit, I've had a part time job there, working about 5 hours a week as a graduate writing consultant. I got this job because (now Doctor) Tammy (of the Voytek Clan) had been working there for around 2 years before me, and recommended me to apply and interview when a new position opened. To be completely honest, I originally wanted this job because I thought I would get a nice little salary bonus to continue supporting my decadent graduate student lifestyle when my external scholarships expired. It turns out that, due to some bullshit university bureaucracy, I can't be paid "overtime" as an international student. So my department had to cut my appointment accordingly, even though I'm obviously still working 120% as a PhD candidate. So I pretty much fucked up because I've effectively been volunteering at this position for the last 16 months.

Fortunately, as it stands, knowing what I know now and having learned what I learnt on this job, I would have jumped on it even if they had told me it was an unpaid internship for 5 hours a week. Hell, for the training I got and the experiences I gained, I might have paid money *to do it*.

[Why? Well, for one, I'm currently writing this blog post on the job as my "off-time" project (I'll explain what that is below), so technically I'm getting paid to write for fun (even though I'm not really getting paid, it all works out in the end guys).]

But more seriously, I had expected this job to be something like: show up, sit down with a fellow graduate student for an hour at a time and edit their extremely technical paper, or abstract, or fellowship application, for jargons and grammar mistakes. That's my preconceived notion of what a "Writing Consultant" at the university library does. Why else would the institution pay for a position like that if it wasn't a horrendously mind-numbing job?

Turns out, that's about 1% of the time on the job. Instead, I've had to learn to be a reader, listener, writer, thought translator and transcriber, and at times, a research advisor and friend (or therapist, if I may use that term unprofessionally) to my fellow graduate students - sometimes all within a single consultation session. I shit you not, in the first two weeks of being on this job (a total combination of ~10 hours, which was actually my training period), I had explicitly learned more about what graduate school writing (and the experience in general) was like, and how to put into words the struggles we all face as scientific writers and thinkers, than I had the previous 5 years combined. It was like coming home after a long and rough day but not knowing what exactly was wrong, until just the right song comes on and you feel. so. damn. heard.

Working as a consultant to problem-solve other graduate students' writing concerns, one needs to be intimately familiar with the PhD Experience (TM pending and purchase not recommended), not only by having implicit knowledge acquired through lived experiences, but also wielding explicit knowledge (in verbalized thoughts and writing) of those issues that we face. When you go to a mental health professional, that's called therapy. When you go to the Writing Hub, it's also very much therapy, but also now you still have this jumbled hot mess of a paper in front of you, that hopefully you don't feel so negatively towards anymore and can take the steps to start making progress on. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I must have advised more PhD students than some faculties on this campus have, just from the sheer number of times I've thought to myself while working with a student, "isn't your advisor suppose to be doing this for you??? Wait...if I'm doing this, why the fuck are they getting paid the big bucks???"

Without giving away all the punchlines (and gripes) in this introduction, the next few posts will be a series: on what I learned from working this job, on writing and common issues I've experienced in others' writings, as well as on being a consultant, a writer, and a PhD student and how those roles have shaped each other. 90% of my blog posts are (more or less) for my own shits and giggles, and it's advised that you read for your own procrastination. This is not one of those. This is **recommended reading** if you're a PhD student, or even a PhD student's advisor, not because there's irreplaceable wisdom that you cannot acquire elsewhere (you can, I did), but simply because you will see that your struggles, be it with writing, thinking, or dealing with grad life, are not yours alone, and that I, our team, and most of the people I've had consultations with all suffered from at one point or another.

With that preamble out of the way, it looks like this one is already getting a little long. It took some time for me to set up the premise in order to sell you the entire series thereafter, so I will use the rest of today's post to briefly dissect the anatomy of a consultation session, so you get a surface-level idea of what actually takes place. In the following posts, I will attempt to distill some of those high-level insights that I found valuable and illuminating for myself as a writer and PhD student, both from my consultation experiences and the training material I've had to read. Finally, if it isn't already dispersed in the various pieces, I will probably take a whole post to talk about (read: shit on) the academic institution as a monolithic whole, how literally nobody in this entire damn enterprise receives adequate (or literally any) and explicit training, and what we can do about it (basically, why this job does but should not need to exist).
