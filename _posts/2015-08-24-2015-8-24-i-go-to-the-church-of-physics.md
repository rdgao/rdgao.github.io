Imagine Bobby. Bobby is the younger you (or for some, the current you) that
first saw a rollercoaster on TV or in real life, and had no idea what that
was. Wouldn't Bobby think to himself and say, "gee, that looks like they might
die at any moment"? But somehow, Bobby overcame his fear and trusted in the
person that told him - be it his parents, friends, or the ad guy on the radio
- that even though the rattling death machines are twisting and turning at
highway speeds topsy-turvy, everything will be alright?

Bobby threw himself into what is observably a deathtrap on the breath someone
exhaled while saying those words, yet because of nothing but this belief, he
somehow avoided being totally freaked out about his life, and even finds
thrill and joy in the ride. For those of you that are thinking, "well Bobby
obviously knows he won't die because of physics, duh!", go try convincing that
friend you know, the one that acts like they got a restraining order on
Canada's Wonderland, to try one of the rides because conservation of energy.

It is not a matter of understanding, but of belief. If you haven't figured out
where I'm going with this, it's this: Bobby is us, that rollercoaster is life
(literally metaphorically), the guarantor is [insert favorite omnipotent
belief system, and we all have one], and science is, well, plain old science.
