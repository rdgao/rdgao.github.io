Since I haven't written any toilet humor in a while and this might take more
than 140 characters:

life is like going to the pooper - sometimes it will come when you want it to,
sometimes it will take its sweet time, but rest assured, there will always be
utter shit and sweet relief at the end of the day.

if not, consider eating more vegetables.
