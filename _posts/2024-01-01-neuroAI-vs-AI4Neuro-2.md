### What is NeuroAI
*So what is NeuroAI?* For the observant reader and seasoned researcher, you probably know where I'm going with this. Similarly, I know who I am now and what I like for breakfast, so in some sense, it's irrelevant for me what NeuroAI is or is not---I know who I need to talk to and where, within and outside the community of NeuroAI researchers. But in case there is a fresh and excited grad student out there who is developing new computational methods based on state of the art AI, whether for the goals of studying neurobiology or simply as an AI researcher, you might find this useful for navigating NeuroAI.

I have to start with the caveat that I'm, obviously, not the person that came up with this name, nor do I have anything to do with it, I just read papers and talk to the people who **do** do NeuroAI research. I'm only a weird person at the intersection of AI and neuroscience, so by no means is this a prescriptive definition of NeuroAI, just my understanding.

And where else to turn to than this [perspective paper][perspective (Zador et al., 2023)] titled: *Catalyzing next-generation Artificial Intelligence through NeuroAI*? It's a nice read, I especially enjoy when such papers come with a historical perspective. A big part of the paper makes the argument that "next-generation" AI will need sensorimotor embodiment, something that is a god-given for animals in the world that *engage their environments, behave flexibly, and compute efficiently*, but tremendously difficult for human-engineered AI systems. No surprises here, since it comes from a group of people who are, I would say, first and foremost neuroscientists. I agree with the take, but I won't discuss the paper beyond this sentence:

> "The emerging field of NeuroAI, at the intersection of neuroscience and AI, is based on the premise that a better understanding of neural computation will reveal fundamental ingredients of intelligence and catalyze the next revolution in AI."







### What NeuroAI is not





### AI for Neuroscience

Fitting enough, NeurIPS---`Neural Information Processing Systems`---was arguably the modern ancestor conference for NeuroAI ("modern" because it came after "cybernetics", which was too...Soviet Union to catch on?). NeurIPS was a place for works looking at how information processing or computation happens in neural and neural-like systems, before weirdly finding itself being **the** place for completely brain-free machine learning papers for some time. Now, in 2024, as the economy goes to shit and big tech companies no longer giving 6-figure salaries to anybody that's ever written a line of `loss.backward()`, maybe we will see NeurIPS coming back to being the playground of computer neuroscientists? If the trend from this year holds up, we'll have gone full circle and come back to analyzing powerful-for-its-time artificial computing systems as we imagine how brains do things, or even as artificial brains, and this, my friends, is a tale as old as time itself. 

But if history serves us correctly, this will not be how we solve neuroscience. Or at least, this alone will not be the way. Strangely enough, I'm convinced of this after being at NeurIPS---and after visiting the Deutsches Museum and playing with some really fun fundamental physics demos--- We need an AI4Neuroscience. 

Computational neuroscience
the method becomes the model
measurements


 (no, the "neurons" in a deep neural network are not neural and we're not having this discussion here)
