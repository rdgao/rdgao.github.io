I am a computational and cognitive **neuroscientist**. My research centers on developing methods in probabilistic ML/AI, neural data and time series analysis, and computational simulators to connect neurobiology with cognition and behavior. I’m also interested in automating science with NLP and language models, and pretty much any kind of interesting data. I've taught [classes][cogs118c] and written [papers][gscholar_rgao] on such things, and you can find out more in [Projects][projects] & [CV][cv].

I'm currently a postdoc researcher working with [Jakob Macke][jhm_twitter] in the Machine Learning in Science group at the University of Tübingen. My main work is on developing simulation and analysis methods for neural population dynamics using generative (ML) and mechanistic (biophysical) models, particularly within the framework of simulation-based inference.

I did my PhD with [Bradley Voytek][bv_twitter] in the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. Now I miss the ocean. Prior to that, I lived in [Toronto, Canada][toronto] for 11 years. It's the place I call home, and also where I received my Bachelor's Degree (University of Toronto, BASc in Engineering Science). I was born and raised in [Xinjiang, China][xinjiang]. There is a lot of grass, mountains, and also deserts there.

I like to be active, mostly by playing basketball, but also hiking, running, and biking when I can. I enjoy silence, meditating, and writing a lot as well. My [blog][blog] spans everything in my life, from musings to reflections about neuroscience and academia. to sports, travels, and science & technology. I ponder a lot about life and our place in this world, and sometimes I write about it. At worst, this website is a representation and a record of my life; at best, it becomes an inspiration to someone who will come back to inspire and educate me.
