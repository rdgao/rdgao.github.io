On a related note, part of the difficulty in talking about science is that I
start to use jargons, not only when I talk about science, but I start to do
this in everyday life. Honestly, I don't think I'm trying to be pompous, they
are just so convenient and describe situations perfectly. Orthogonal, for
example, is such a conveniently packaged word that can be applied to everyday
problems, which describes two/or many aspects of a thing that can vary
independently of each other, e.g. ISIS and the refugee crisis are not
orthogonal issues. The literal meaning of "orthogonal" is "perpendicular",
mathematically, which makes absolutely no sense in real life. It's probably
closer to "independent" in regular-speak, though that word has its own
connotations inherited from probabilities. Another word I abuse now is
"projection", which, applied in regular life, basically means to ignore some
aspects of a problem and focus on the dimensions that are tractable. Okay I
think just abused "dimension". Anyway, the point is, academics come up with a
lot of terms to precisely describe an abstract, well-defined situation. But
one can often generalize real-life scenarios to
