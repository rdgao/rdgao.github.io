Day 2:
LFP biophysics

Cameron McIntyre
  - subthalamic DBS implant LFP - beta correlates with units
  - subthalamic cells have different morph and configuration from ctx cells

Andreas Kuhn
  - clinically relevant features in STN DBS

Helen Bronte-Stewart
  - resting state DBS LFP recording in STN
  - spectrum is 'stationary'


Day 1:

Ken-ichi Amemori (Graybiel):
  - beta stimulation

Scott Cole (Voytek):
  - waveform shape in time domain
Alex Gramfort:
  DAR:
  - Driven AutoRegreassive models for search
  - driver signal (low-freq) serves as time-varying AR parameters for the high frequency osc.
  - Robust to bandwidth/frequency of driving signal
  - can vary various parameters and compute likelihood
  CSC:
  - convolutional sparse coding
  - topography x waveform (conv) activation
  - alphaCSC extracts kernels
  MNE:

Jaana Simola (M. & S. Palvas)
  - measuring network connectivity via MEG & phase/amplitude synchrony
  - visual alpha lateralization & network synchrony (graph strength) predicts Posner task performance
  - __Lobier et al., NI 2017__

Hyeyoung Shin (Jones Lab)
  - beta, MEG
  - beta power predicts inhibited performance across tasks, species and modalities
  - measuring beta transient events (number, power, duration, freq-span) from spectrogram in a per-trial fashion
  - nice complement to time-domain (bycycle) measures
  - dynamic (beta-length vs. pause) vs. burst generator: found evidence for stochastic durations, i.e. random pause times
  - event number correlates the most with prestimulus beta power and non-detection
  -  prestim beta event __closer__ to stim predicts non-detection
  - __would this explain stochastic distribution of per-trial power in visual gamma? Should check motor beta as well in ECoG__
  - good Q: does power, event number, and duration etc explain different portions of performance variance

Jason Samaha (Samaha/Postle)
  - quantifying alpha oscillatory frequency
  - phase matters, does frequency?
  - MX Cohen instantaneous frequency method (MXC JN 2014)
  - __'instantaneous' is wrt to the complex sinusoid, but integrated over many samples during filter and hilbert stage__
  - FT based method cannot resolve 0.2Hz difference, MXC method can but under-estimates freq in noise, improves when SNR increases
  - inter-subject alpha freq inversely correlates with two-flash fusion threshold (better temporal resolution), works within subject on a per-trial basis too

Ali Mazaheri (Mazaheri)
  - __Corcoran et al. 2018__
  - alpha frequency & pain
  - slow alpha <> longer pain duration (years)
  - 9-11Hz alpha CoG (power-weighted freq)
  - capsicin induced pain: slow alpha <> more pain & duration, also slowing down <> pain

Andrew Watrous (Watrous/Josh Jacobs)
  - MODAL - time-frequency detection of oscillations
  - rate and theta spike-phase coding neurons in the human MTL
  - probabilistic detection

Tom Donoghue (Voytek)
  - FOOOOOOOOOOF

Josh Jacobs (Jacobs)
  - traveling waves (theta/alpha) in temporal cortex
  - circular-linear model __(Fisher 1995)__
  - also exist elsewhere and at other freqs
  - __referencing__?
  - wave collision between occipital alpha and MT/frontal theta?
  - consistency of traveling direction correlates with performance
  - __Ermentrout & Kleinfeld 2001__
  - whole cortex vector field show posterior to anterior propagation
  - __higher freq oscillations are also travelling faster__
  - __neuronal population time constant across cortex?__
  - __Zhang et al 2018, Neuron__

Lyle Muller (Sejnowski)
  - generalized (wideband) phase
  - __Muller et al 2016, elife, Nat Comm 2014__
  - __does traveling wave depend on recording depth__?
  - spontaneous and non-isotropic waves, phase locking
  - impacts visual perception threshold

Saskia Haegens ()
  - oscillations implement low-level functional blocks (e.g. inhibition, ensemble formation, sampling, etc)
  - frequency variability between subjects
  - peak freq increases with cognitive demand
  - inverse correlation between alpha power and broadband (HFA) power


general thoughts
  - lots of complementary packages but unclear how to use all of them
  - fuller characterization of oscillations (frequency, 1/f, travel)
  - loglog plots
