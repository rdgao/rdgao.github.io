Guide to imposter syndrome

To deal with a problem, you have to first dissect and understand it. In this case, what is imposter syndrome?

Imposter syndrome can take on a few different forms, perhaps on a spectrum of severity. The most severe being a literal feeling of being an imposter, i.e., somebody made a mistake in letting me be here. I've felt this in my first year of my grad school, and more prominently, in the first semester of undergrad. The accompanying thought is usually "I don't deserve to be here because the people around me are so much more capable, so it's probably an accident." This is a terrible feeling, and there's really only two ways to deal with it: tell the person that made the decision that they fucked up, or go about your day because it's not your responsibility. If somebody made the wrong decision, it's on them, and you got lucky, which is great! When I first started grad school, I really thought I had no idea why they picked me to be here, not because I thought I was dumb, but because I knew nothing about neuroscience or cognitive science, and I had no real scientific research experience, by my own standards anyway. After a while though, I kind of just forgot about it, because it literally doesn't matter what I think. Whether I was admitted by mistake or not, I was here. Unless I wanted to volunteer myself out of it, there's no point worrying about it, and that's that.

That's the most extreme form of imposter syndrome, and I think what I'm about to describe is a more common and less extreme form, which I call incompetence syndrome. I think most of the time, and for longer periods, it's not that we feel we're literal imposters, but simply that we fear we're incompetent. I think this is a very important distinction to make for combatting imposter syndrome.

Let's say you're invited to give a talk amongst a panel of distinguished scientists, or that your art work is chosen to be exhibited along the best artists in your field. Imposter syndrome is thinking someone made a mistake to bring you here, Incompetence syndrome is the fear that you'll out yourself as a total fraud when the talk comes or when the exhibit opens, and that people will think you're stupid. Why is this a necessary distinction? Because there's nothing you can do about the former, and there's a lot you can do about the latter. In fact, feeling incompetent is not even a bad thing. You should feel incompetent, especially when you start out, because you are incompetent. If every grad student went into their first year of PhD feeling competent, what is the point of the doing the PhD?

I think high functioning people - in academia, business, law, medicine, whatever - have a high rate of "imposter syndrome" because they're used to being competent, and feeling incompetent for the first time is scary, and we want to reject that fear so we are even harder on ourselves for feeling incompetent in the first place. And the reason I wanted to write about imposter syndrome is that I think sometimes it might be unhealthy and counterproductive to tell a trainee to not feel imposter syndrome, when really they're feeling incompetent. Incompetent syndrome is something that can and should be treated with practice and work, and is NEVER going to go away just because they know they "shouldn't feel that way". One day or another, the bubble will burst and they will learn that they truly have been incompetent, and hopefully it's not in a high stake situation, and that's kind of the point of training - fuck it up all you can while you're under someone else's guidance, so you don't have to when you're running your own study.

So my advice for a new grad student or new whatever is -
