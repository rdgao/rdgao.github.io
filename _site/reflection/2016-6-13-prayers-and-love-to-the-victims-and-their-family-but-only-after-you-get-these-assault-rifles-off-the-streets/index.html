      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>Last night I went to a friend’s place to celebrate having made it through our
second year of graduate school together. There was great company and plenty to
drink, and at some point we called it a night and I went to sleep on their
couch. Next thing I know, it was the morning and I woke up. Didn’t feel like
the world’s greatest, but I woke up.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I learned that, just as we celebrated our lives last night,
many more were celebrating their own, in a club across the country. The only
difference was, 50 of them never woke up this morning. And of the hundreds
that did, their lives were probably changed forever.</p>

<p>When I first heard of this, my instinctive reaction was “wow…Murica, I
guess.” I didn’t think much more about it and went on to eat a big meal of
chicken waffles, thinking that this will be just another hung-over Sunday. But
for some reason, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I couldn’t stop thinking
about it and I couldn’t stop reading about it, and the more I read, the more
confused I felt. I was confused about why I was so sad and angry. Not to sound
callous, but usually reading the news doesn’t get me riled up anymore,
because, well, shit happens. Shit happens all over the world, and usually
there is a reason for it - be it civil unrest, religious conflict, or domestic
dispute. And usually, reason alone is enough for me to shrug my shoulders and
move on. But I couldn’t today, and I finally realized why:</p>

<p><strong>There is no fucking reason why a civilian in this country should be able to
leave a store with a legally purchased AR-15, a semi-automatic, military-grade
(M16) assault rifle. None at all.</strong></p>

<p>Reading about events like this, it’s certainly guaranteed that you will run
into a gamut of knee-jerk reactions, be it on social media or “real” news
outlets. Of course, there is the anti-Islam reaction, and we were graced with
the Donald’s personal and thoughtful opinion on this matter. That’s fine, you
know what, I get it. If some dude pledges allegiance to ISIS and shoots up the
city, I can see why a conservative and traditional American upbringing can
lead you to have that fear reaction. I don’t think it’s reasonable, but I can
see why, and I don’t know how to solve this problem either. There is also the
reaction of sending love to the LGBT community, and how intolerance towards a
different life choice indoctrinated by an Islamic (or religious, in general)
upbringing is to be lamented over (and of course, politicians’ prayers).
Finally, as always, a peak in interest in mental health often co-occurs with
mass shootings, though it wasn’t so prominent today since, well, it wasn’t a
white dude. All of these reactions are warranted and reasonable, and they
deserve further discussion. Of course, Islamic extremism is a real security
issue and needs to be treated with sensitivity, not with a dogmatic and
militant viewpoint (be it left- or right-leaning). And of course, mental
health and discrimination against the LGBT community are also real and
persistent issues that deserve our attention. But frankly, I don’t think today
is the time and place for those things, because <strong>talking about ISIS or gay-
intolerance takes the attention off of a very real and tangible problem</strong> :</p>

<p>How do you prevent one mentally unstable person from killing 50 people in a
crowded place?</p>

<p>It doesn’t take a genius to figure out: maybe you shouldn’t sell them a
fucking machine design to kill many people very, very quickly. This is just
fucking absurd. If I could use all the cuss words in my lifetime today to
describe how ridiculous this situation is, I would. Because it is just,
absolutely, fucking, absurd. Instead of having the Islam debate or the
homophobic debate - which, again, are important things to talk about but have
no clear course of action - every single media outlet should focus on the only
thing we know for certain, which is that had the shooter not have a semi-
automatic ASSAULT RIFLE, he wouldn’t have been able to kill 50 and injure many
more in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>My sadness, anger, and frustration stems solely from this incomprehensible
fact. Like I said before, people die all the time, and it sucks, but most of
the time I don’t get too worked up because you can conjure up some high-level
explanation for it. But for this, today, there is no explanation. And it
REALLY hit me when I read the first article that linked it to Sandy Hook, in
referencing it as the worst mass shooting in American history. Why? Because I
completely forgot about Sandy Hook, and that’s the scariest thing about this.
News stories will inevitably fall off in popularity, at which point we can
move on to be outraged by the next thing. But we cannot afford to just move on
from this. There is no discussion needed as to what could be done to prevent
things like this from happening again. Yes, if he wasn’t an ISIS sympathizer
or a terrorist, it probably wouldn’t have happened; and yes, if he wasn’t a
homophobe, it probably wouldn’t have happened - probably! But we know for
CERTAIN that if those rifles had not been accessible, 50 people would not have
died. Maybe 3 or 5 in a knife fight, and that would be another regular day at
the night club. But not 50, and not potentially more when he held the
remaining people hostage. You can’t hold a building hostage with a goddamn
knife.</p>

<p>Just in case you’re really hung up on one of the other “causes” of this
tragedy, consider this: it could’ve easily been a white, non-religious
shooter, and it could’ve easily been at a mall or a school or a movie theatre.
Easily. Not convinced? Well, they all happened, in the last 5 years. <strong>And the
only thing linking these tragedies? Not ISIS, but the very<a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/orlando-nightclub-
massacre/ar-15-rifle-used-orlando-massacre-has-bloody-pedigree-n590581">same assault
rifle</a>.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>I don’t have anything intelligent to say about the Islamic situation, because
I don’t know if he was inspired, brainwashed, or just hijacked for publicity.
But I will just say this: if you are one of those people that are dead set
about this being about ISIS and an act of terrorism, then you should agree
that somebody should be responsible for arming these goddamn terrorists.
Supplying firepower to a member of a terrorist organization is a criminal
offense and is not far from treason, so should we not prosecute the arms
seller and manufacturer?</p>

<p>I don’t really know where I’m going with this anymore, except for the fact
that I’m still simultaneously fucking livid and heartbroken. It just baffles
me. It just feels like we can actually DO SOMETHING about this, but I don’t
know what! How do you get the politicians to get their heads out of somebody
else’s ass so they can do something reasonable and think about the
consequences of any old Joe being able to walk into a gun store and buy a
military-grade assault weapon? How???</p>

<p><strong>You know what, my American friends, if you feel the same way about this or
perhaps know somebody that have the insight as to what we can do, please share
this, because I just don’t understand why this is happening over and over
again, and I don’t want to have the pleasure of being this worked up over yet
another tragedy in the near future.</strong></p>

<p>And you know what’s really ironic in all of this? I’m fucking Canadian.</p>

<p>Please, fix your goddamn country.</p>
