<hr />

<p><strong>Highlights (tl;dr)</strong></p>

<p>The overarching goal of our recent <em>NeuroImage</em> paper
(<a href="http://voyteklab.com/wp-content/uploads/Gao-NeuroImage2017.pdf">PDF</a>) is to
make inferences about the brain’s synaptic/molecular-level processes using
large-scale (very much non-molecular or microscopic) electrical recordings. In
the following blog post, I will take you through the concept of excitation-
inhibition (EI) balance, why it’s important to quantify, and how we go about
doing so in the paper, which is the novel contribution. It’s aimed at a broad
audience, so there are a lot of analogies and oversimplifications, and I refer
you to the paper itself for the gory details. At the end, I reflect a little
on the process and talk about the real (untold) story of how this paper came
to be. <em>**</em></p>

<p><strong>A Tale of Two Forces</strong></p>

<p>Inside all of our brains, there are two fundamental and opposing forces – no,
not good and evil – excitation and inhibition. Excitatory input, well,
“excites” a neuron, causing it to depolarize (become more positively charged
internally) and fire off an action potential if enough excitatory inputs
converge. This is the fundamental mechanism by which neurons communicate:
shorts bursts of electrical impulses. Inhibitory inputs, on the other hand, do
exactly the opposite: they hyperpolarize a neuron, making it less likely to
fire an action potential. Not to be hyperbolic, but since before you were born
these two forces were waging war with and balancing one another through
embryonic development, infancy, childhood, adulthood, and till death. There
are lots of molecular mechanisms for excitation and inhibition, but for the
most part, “excitatory neurons” are responsible for sending excitation via a
neurotransmitter called glutamate, and “inhibitory neurons” are responsible
for inhibition via GABA.</p>

<p><img src="/squarespace_images/static_5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73_535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd_59c0ac641f318d7ed8ccbbc8_1505799282628_EI.png_" alt="" /></p>

<p>Like all great rivalries (think Batman and Joker, Celtics and Lakers), these
two forces cannot exist without each other, but they also keep each other in
check: too much excitation leads the brain to have run-away activity, such as
what happens in seizure, while too much inhibition shuts everything down, as
happens during sleep, anesthesia, or being drunk. This makes intuitive sense,
and scientists have empirically validated this “excitation-inhibition balance”
concept numerous times. This EI balance, as it’s called, is ubiquitous under
normal conditions, and has been proposed to be crucial for neural computation,
the routing of information in the brain, and many other processes.
Furthermore, it’s been hypothesized, with some experimental evidence in
animals, that an imbalance of excitation and inhibition is the cause (or
result) of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy,
schizophrenia, and autism, just to name a few.</p>

<p><strong>Finding Balance</strong></p>

<p>Given how important this intricate balance is, it is actually quite difficult
to measure at any moment the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. I
mentioned above that there is empirical evidence for balance and imbalance.
However, in the vast majority of these cases, measurements are done by poking
<strong>tiny</strong> electrodes into single neurons and, via a protocol called voltage
clamping, scientists record <em>within</em> a single neuron how much excitatory and
inhibitory input that neuron is receiving. Because the setup is so delicate,
it’s often done in slices of brain tissue kept alive in a dish, or sometimes
in a head-fixed, anesthetized mouse or rat – basically, in brain tissue that
can’t move much, but not in humans. I mean, imagine doing this in the intact
brain of a living human – yeah, I can’t either. And as far as I know, it’s
never been done. This presents a pretty big conundrum: if we want to link a
psychiatric disorder to an improper ratio between excitation and inhibition in
the human brain directly, but we can’t actually measure that thing, how can we
corroborate that EI (im)balance matters in the way we think it does?</p>

<p><img src="/squarespace_images/static_5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73_535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd_59c0ac86e3df2804bd831f2e_1505799312222_imbalance.png_" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Our Approach: Parsing Balance From “Background Noise”</strong></p>

<p>This is exactly the problem we try to solve in our recent paper published in
<em>NeuroImage</em> : how might one estimate the ratio between excitation and
inhibition in a brain region without having to invasively record from within a
brain cell (which is not something most people would like to happen to them)?</p>

<p>Well, recording inside a brain cell is hard, but recording outside brain cells
– extracellularly – is a LOT easier. It’s still pretty invasive, depending on
the technique, but much safer and more feasible in moving, living, behaving
people. Of course, recording outside the brain cell is not the same as
recording the inside – when we record electrical fluctuations in the space
<em>around</em> neurons, rather from within or right next to a single neuron, we’re
picking up the activity of <em>thousands to millions</em> of cells all <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Local_field_potential">mixed up
together</a>.</p>

<p>The first critical idea of our paper was that this aggregate signal – often
referred to as the local field potential (LFP) – reflects excitatory and
inhibitory inputs onto a large population of local cells, not just a single
one. Therefore, we should be able to get a general estimate of balance by
decoding this aggregate signal. The second piece of critical information was
the realization that (for the most part) excitatory inputs are fast and
inhibitory inputs are slow so that, even when they are mixed together from
millions of different sources like in the LFP signal, we are still able to
separate their effects: not in time, but in the frequency-domain (see our
<a href="https://github.com/voytekresearch/tutorials/blob/master/Power%20Spectral%20Density%20and%20Sampling%20Tutorial.ipynb">frequency domain
tutorial</a>).</p>

A: LFP model with excitatory and inhibitory inputs; B: the time course of E
and I inputs from a single action potential; C: simulated synaptic inputs
(blue and red) and LFP (black); F: LFP index of E:I ratio</p>

<p><strong>Combining</strong> <strong>Computational</strong> <strong>Modeling</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Empirical (Open) Data</strong></p>

<p>Pursuing this line of reasoning, we simulated populations of neurons <em>in
silico</em> and looked at how their activity would generate a local field
potential recording. What this means is that we can generate, in a computer
simulation, different ratios of excitatory or inhibitory inputs into a brain
region and see how that influences the simulated LFP. Through this
computational model we found an index for the relative ratio between
excitation and inhibition.</p>

<p>For those of you that are into frequency-domain analysis of neural signal,
this index is the 1/f power law exponent of the LFP power spectrum. Let’s
unpack that a bit. In the figure above (panel B) you can see that the
excitatory electrical currents (blue) that contribute to the LFP shoot up in
voltage really quickly—within a few thousands of a second—and then slowly
decay back down to zero. In contrast, the inhibitory currents (red) also shoot
up pretty quickly—but not <em>as</em> quickly—and then decay back to zero <em>much</em> more
slowly than the excitatory inputs. When you add up thousands of these currents
happening all at different times, the simulated voltage (panel C, black) looks
to us humans a lot like noise. But through the mathematical magic of the
Fourier transform, when we look at this same signal’s frequency
representation, they’re clearly distinguishable!</p>

<p>More technically, the idea is that the ratio between fast excitation and slow
inhibition should be represented by the relative strength between high-
frequency (rapidly fluctuating) and low-frequency (slowly fluctuating)
signals. With this hypothesis in hand, we were able to make use of several
publicly available databases of neural recordings to validate the predictions
made by our computational models in a few different ways. One example from the
paper: we were lucky enough to find a recording from macaque monkeys
undergoing anesthesia, and the anesthetic agent, propofol, acts through
amplifying inhibitory inputs in the brain at GABA synapses. Therefore, we
predicted that when the monkey goes under, we should see a corresponding
change in the power law exponent, and that’s exactly what we found! As you can
see below, our EI index remains relatively stable during the awake state, then
immediately shoots down toward an inhibition-greater-than-excitation regime
during the anesthetized state before coming back to baseline after the
anesthesia wears off.</p>

<p><img src="/squarespace_images/static_5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73_535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd_59c0acdc017db2a991be001e_1505799399607_monkey.png_" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Takeaways and Disclaimers</strong></p>

<p>So to summarize, we were able to make predictions, borne out of observations
from previous physiological experiments and our own computational modeling,
and then validate these predictions using data from <strong>existing databases</strong> to
draw a link between EI balance, which is a cellular-level process, and the
local field potential, which is an aggregate circuit-level signal. Personally,
I think that bridging the gap between these different levels of description in
the brain is super interesting, and it’s one way for us to confirm our
understanding of how the brain gives rise to cognition and behavior at
multiple scales. Furthermore, we can now make use of the theoretical idea of
EI balance in places where it was previously inaccessible, such as a human
patients responding to treatments.</p>

<p>Before I wrap up, I just want to point out that <strong>this paper does not
conclusively show that EI balance directly shifts the power law exponent</strong> –
what we show is a suggestive correlation. Nor does the correlation hold under
all circumstances. We had to make a lot of assumptions in our model and the
data we found, such as the noise-like process by which we generated the model
inputs. I’m not throwing this out here to inhibit the excitement (hah, hah),
but rather to limit the scope of our claim, especially for a public-facing
blog piece like this.</p>

<p>Rather, ours is the first step of an ongoing investigation, and although we
will probably find evidence that <a href="http://voyteklab.com/more-
evidence-1f-lffp-noise-indexes-excitationinhibition-balance/">corroborates</a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09042">contradicts</a> our findings later on, it’s
important that anyone reading this and getting excited (hah) about it
understands that we do not, and likely will not, have the last word on this.
Ultimately, though, I believe we stumbled onto something pretty cool and we’ll
definitely follow up on those assumptions one by one, and hopefully have more
blog posts to come!</p>

<p><strong>Some Personal Reflection</strong></p>

<p>This project was my first real scientific research project in grad school, and
it definitely created in me a lot of joy and excitement, as well as caused a
fair amount of brooding. As a whole, I really enjoyed the process of building
a computational model, even if it was quite simple, and using the predictions
from that to inform further empirical investigations. As I mentioned, I think
we really need to bridge the gap between molecular-level mechanisms in the
brain and circuit/organism-level “neural markers”, and computational modeling
work allows us to do that in situations where it would be intractable for many
reasons. I certainly subscribe to the notion that combining
theoretical/computational work with empirical data is an exciting and fruitful
line of research, because it fills a space between two successful but largely
non-overlapping subfields in neuroscience (though that trend is now changing).</p>

<p>Also, the fact that we were able to test our predictions on publicly available
data was such a blessing, as we simply did not have the capacity, as a new
lab, to do those <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> experiments ourselves. However, that
meant combing through tons and tons of data where there might have been
unlabeled or badly labeled information, only to reach the conclusion that the
data is unusable for our purposes. There was some (a lot) of headbanging due
to this, but ultimately, we found useful (FREE!) data and I’m very grateful
for the people that made them available: <a href="https://crcns.org/data-
sets/hc/hc-2/about-hc-2">CRCNS</a> and Buzsaki Lab, <a href="http://neurotycho.org/">Neurotycho</a>
and Fujii Lab, as well as many friends and collaborators that donated data for
us to test different routes. To support this open-access endeavor, all code
used to produce the analysis and figures are on our lab GitHub, found
<a href="https://github.com/voytekresearch/eislope">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Untold Story</strong></p>

<p>One last note, for those of you that find the process of scientific discovery
interesting: in this blog post, I tried to write the story as a lay-friendly
CliffsNotes version of the paper, starting with the importance of EI balance
and the motivation to find an accessible index of it in the LFP, then
outlining how we went about solving that problem. That’s the scientific story,
and while not false, it’s not chronological.</p>

<p>The actual story began with <a href="http://voyteklab.com/journal-
of-neuroscience-paper-age-related-changes-in-1f-neural-electrophysiological-
noise/">Brad’s 2015 paper</a> showing that aging is associated with 1/f changes. That was actually
what first interested me back when I started in 2014 – this seemingly
ubiquitous phenomenon (1/f scaling) in neural data. After digging a bit to
find various accounts for how 1/f observations arise in nature, we decided to
just simulate the LFP ourselves and see what happens. Turns out, the 1/f
naturally falls out of the temporal profile of synaptic currents, which both
have exponential rise and decay.</p>

<p>Our model contained what I thought to be the bare minimum: excitatory and
inhibitory currents. At that point, I didn’t have a clue about what EI balance
was and what it has been linked to. I think I was twiddling parameters one
day, and realized that changing the relative weight of E and I inputs will
cause the 1/f exponent (or slope) to change because of their different time
constants. Then, like any modern-day graduate student, I Googled to see if
this is something that actually happens <em>in vivo</em> , and the rest was history.
This little anecdote really just speaks to the serendipity of science, and it
couldn’t have happened without the many hours of spontaneous discussions in
the lab, which I’m also very grateful for, and Google. I think these little
stories really liven up the otherwise logical world of science, and I’d love
to read about such stories from other people!</p>
