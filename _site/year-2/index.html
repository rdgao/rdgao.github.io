        <p>It’s that time of the year again - my third year of graduate school will
officially begin in a few days, and I thought this would be a great
opportunity to reflect on the last year and pass this wisdom onto future me.
But first, I decided to take a look at what I wrote down for <a href="http://www.rdgao.com/year-1-part-2">Year
1</a>, and boy was there ever
some golden nuggets of wisdom that I completely ignored after writing them
down. This blurb, though, summarizes very nicely what appears to be extremely
clever foresight but, in hindsight, something I would’ve never kept in mind
until it actually happened:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… having reflected on the year, is that when the two forces - passion and
competitiveness - join hands, it’s very easy to spiral into a thoughtless
routine and reach a burn-out stage with little warning. In other words, if we
enforce the notion that what we are doing is what we are passionate in, mixed
with the (Asian? North American?) culture of “always-be-doing”, then we tend
to ignore our own bodies and the natural signals to relax and refocus.
Eventually, some threshold is exceeded and fear overcomes passion, curiosity,
and joy of exploring, at which point work becomes a burden and all I can do is
youtube/imgur, possibly leading to existential crises and the conclusion that
science is a pointless circle-jerk. Short of that, I had to squeeze every
possible moment I had out of life and into work, which meant exercising less,
both mind and body, and resort to things like Soylent (still love my goop
though).</p>

  <p>More subtly, there is a problem of not prioritizing. Essentially, all work
related things are deemed to be more important than personal things, based on
some notion that “I have to”, and all those things are weighted equally so I
need to DO ALL THE THINGS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds pretty ominous. Thinking back to first year, I don’t recall going
through a terribly bad phase of burn-out. Tired, for sure, but not
intrinsically unmotivated, which leads me to wonder how I had been able to
foresee the subsequent issues without changing my behavior to prevent it - and
I had to think for a total of 10 seconds to realize why. But to properly tell
the story, we have to pick up where we left off - the beginning of Year 2.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>The Ups</strong></p>

<p>The beginning of year 2 started after a nice west coast road trip with Mei,
stopping along the way to see some natural Murican beauty and old friends.
That was a great way to rest my brain for a bit and refocus before the start
of the new academic year. I got right back into my projects, one of which was
steadily picking up steam and getting positive results. On top of that, I had
just gotten a short commentary published, proposing a computational
(mathematical) model for a set of new empirical results, which counts for
nothing in terms of academic currency but helped me feel like I could at least
write “academic” enough to pretend to be one. All of these factors got me
zooming through life once again, working and reading non-stop. As I write this
now, I realized that, even as I had concerns about burning out and losing
interest, there was no reason to change anything I was doing. Why would I?
Everything was going great. I thought, or rather, I knew that as long as I
keep up with reading everything I could find, and thinking about the problems
24/7, it would eventually all pay off and I’d be outta here (PhD) in no time.
Plus, I felt like I had a good enough handle on my personal relationships,
namely, making friends here and figuring out bit by bit how to tend to an
ultra-long-distance relationship. Life was fast, but good.</p>

<p>Then in the fall, I attended my first Society for Neuroscience conference,
which is THE neuroscience conference to be (sort of), where 20-some-thousand
people gather for a week to nerd out about all aspects of the brain. It was 8
am to 6 pm days, followed by socials and what-have-you well into the night. It
was probably the most intense 5 days of graduate school so far, trying to
catch every poster and talk that interested me. But at the same time, it was
an exhilarating experience because I felt like I was in the hub of discovery
and everyone else was interested in the same things! I presented my own work
there as well, and had a great time with the lab, further strengthening my
feeling of being integrated into the scientific community - of feeling like I
knew what I’m doing. The start of 2016 would prove to be even more
extraordinarily lucky. With some willing collaborators and clever insights, we
were able to find new pieces of evidence that really improved the state of my
project. Even more fortunately, that project landed me a spot at one of the
more specialized and competitive conferences, where I enjoyed some truly great
talks and discussions with experts in computational neuroscience, as well as
getting a chance to learn snowboarding in a great resort in Utah. After
returning from that trip, the project was just about done and so we quickly
hammered out a draft that was about 3 days from being submitted, and
entertained the idea of several top journals because we all believed that the
work was just that solid and impactful. And how I would stumble onto something
that cool in my second year of PhD, who the hell knows?</p>

<p>There is a funny Chinese tradition that your “zodiac years” - when you are 12,
24, 36, etc - are the most unlucky years, where personal injuries or
unfortunate disasters were more likely to happen to you, something about your
zodiac animal offending the gods. Well, 8 months into being 24 and I felt
lucky as ever.</p>

<p>Too lucky, in fact.</p>

<p>Amidst the daily push towards completing my first real research project and
publishing a paper, there was always a nagging thought that plagued me - the
better everything was, the louder that voice got. In hindsight, this would
prove to be the biggest case of <strong>imposter syndrome</strong> : the conception of my
successful project was, more than anything, a lucky insight that stemmed from
lab bantering, and so the bigger it grew, the more worried I was that I would
not be able to replicate, both the actual discovery itself and my apparent
stroke of genius. What if I turned out to be a one-hit-wonder? Worse yet, what
if I turn out to be a fraud of a scientist?? I started graduate school feeling
like I was in a blind race against every other graduate student on the planet,
simply because I didn’t even know what I didn’t know about neuroscience. At
this point, however, I stopped racing against other people, which is good, and
started racing against my own shadow that began to run ahead of me, which is
not good. I can’t tell you when, but at some point the work became less
important than the perception of myself I was actively trying to maintain, or
at least, putting more thought into. I am now, of course, both embarrassed and
ashamed to admit that that had been the case, but in the moment, it was, like,
a REALLY big deal for some reason, and I’m sure it’s not an uncommon feeling
for people. They named it a syndrome because enough people had it, obviously.</p>

<p>Well, as it turns out, I had one more lucky draw, and that prevented this
whole fear from ever materializing.</p>

<p><strong>The Downs</strong></p>

<p>Long story short, somebody (thankfully) was able to find a pretty crucial
mistake I made in my analysis. It wasn’t a programming error, but a stupid
decision in the analysis routine that I made quickly on the first pass that,
to this day, haunts my conscience - because I can’t say for certain whether I
completely overlooked it, or if I rolled with it so happily and hastily
because it produced results consistent with my hypothesis. In any case, that
was about the only unexpected “bad” thing that had happened, which,
objectively speaking, really shouldn’t have had too big of an impact. It was
simply a matter of re-running the analysis and seeing what the new results
produced, but instead, it kickstarted a cascade of uncertainty in my work and
myself.</p>

<p>To start, that particular analysis, when done correctly, did not support the
hypothesis. The good news is that it did not contradict the ongoing
hypothesis, thank the sweet lord, but it was inconclusive. That meant a
splashy piece of evidence was suddenly yanked from what could’ve been a
splashy paper, which now, in addition to it being a less splashy paper, meant
no paper at all for at least a few more weeks as I reorganize. At the time, I
tried my best to give it the “shit happens bro” attitude, and Mei had been
here for that particular week so at least we got fried chicken together, but I
think I only realized afterwards how big of a punch in the face that was. It
was something I had worked very hard on, and had gotten <strong>that</strong> close to
submitting a real research paper to a real journal, then all of a sudden,
poof. I was disappointed and felt stupid, and it was the first confirmation
that “yup, I just got way too lucky.” On top of that, I felt like I had wasted
everyone else’s time for the last 2 months or so. From that point on, I made a
choice to be more thorough and critical with my own work, which is, of course,
good in principle and for the long term, but that just meant further delaying
what was supposed to be a done deal while I left no stone unturned in a quest
to at least prevent the preventable stupidity. Obviously there was never a
guarantee that the paper would have been accepted or even reviewed, but I
think I was sufficiently prepared for the peer-review process being a long
pain in the ass that I would’ve been okay - at least I did all that I could do
to get to that point. But to get so close and be turned away was, at the lack
of a better phrase, a big fucking downer.</p>

<p>Like I said, one unfortunate thing happening shouldn’t have been that
devastating. But if my whole foundation of self-worth and values were based on
work, then, of course, anything getting in the way of that meant I had nothing
else to fall back on. As a side note, I finally understood why people were
just so appalled with the idea of Soylent - it’s a fundamental difference in
value systems. I love eating and making great food for personal joy, but when
I make it my mission to devote every living minute I possibly can to further
my work, then it makes perfect sense that I’d want to make my meals as
efficiently as possible, and I’m convinced that Soylent is TRULY the most
efficient way of consuming life-sustaining nutrients, just not the most
enjoyable. Other people, though, had different value systems, in which
personal joy in the short term, and in tangible ways, was very important.
Soylent appeared to be simply fuel for somebody who has become a robot, which
was actually not too far from the reality. It was, in hindsight, a cry for
help, or for somebody to take me out for lunch haha. The best part of that
whole fiasco was that my Soylent binge had apparently inspired a friend in the
lab to purchase such a big order that he couldn’t finish drinking it before a
big chunk of the remainder expired. Sorry Simon.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the main point. What I’ve realized is that life is like
marathons - not a single marathon, but multiple simultaneous ones. You’re
running one in getting to your career goals, but also one in maintaining good
health, one for keeping up with hobbies, and one for fostering relationships
with important people in your life. Sometimes we can dedicate all of our
efforts to make a sprint in one particular race for a small amount of time,
but in the long term, <strong>balance</strong> is crucial, lest you fall on your face in
one race and look back to see how well you’re doing in the other aspects of
your life, only to have the other versions of you stare back from the starting
line looking very confused. The worst part in all of this was that even when
good things happened, they only served as further reminders that I had no clue
what I was doing. For example, as a degree requirement to move onto the third
year, we all had to give a talk summarizing the first 2 years of research
progress to the entire department. Mine went really well and people seemed to
have enjoyed it, but my first thought? Maybe I should just become a science
journalist instead because sure, I can tell a science story, but CAN I
ACTUALLY SCIENCE?!? I’ve been familiar enough with the concept of impostor
syndrome ever since undergrad, but I never thought that I’d ever be afflicted
by it. A big part of it, I think, is due to my hyper awareness of the harsh
realities of academia, which brings me to …</p>

<p><strong>Root Causes &amp; Takeaways</strong></p>

<p>So, after that long-winded story, what can I (and hopefully, you) take away
from all of this? Having gone through this, I know that even if I had known
what would’ve happened a year ago, I doubt I would’ve changed a damn thing,
especially in terms of my life style and mindset. Such is being young.
Although, there are things that would’ve given me comfort had I known about it
beforehand. I’m not that much older now but I can certainly tell you that work
is not everything there is to life, and there are much smarter ways of getting
things done without spending ALL of your time on it. Laziness is the mother of
all inventions, I think that firmly applies here - I only learned how to skim
for crucial information in papers when I told myself there is no fucking way
I’m spending an hour to read every single word of every paper. If there was
one thing I regret, it’s probably not dedicating enough time to my personal
relationships, both in terms of nurturing old ones and growing new ones. It
doesn’t help that I lived on campus, which meant I literally can live in my
work if I wanted to, but thankfully that’s changing. So yeah, first thing is
<strong>balance in all things that make me happy</strong>. I don’t regret drinking Soylent
though - NEVER!!!</p>

<p>The second thing gets at one of the root causes of my specific situation,
which is the systematic issues in academia (or any high-pressure environment)
leading to a lack of confidence in myself. In particular, the bleak picture
that is presented as life in academia. Even though my immediate surroundings
(lab, advisor, department) never gave me any pressure to produce in order to
survive through graduate school and academia, one cannot help but be exposed
to the harsh realities that everyone falls victim to, from graduate student to
distinguished faculty alike: the mantra of publish or perish, the emphasis on
“good” or “glam” journals, tiny percentages of PhDs getting research jobs, how
long professors nowadays need to wait till their first major grant, the list
goes on. Part of that message is genuinely good advice to give young
scientists a realistic view of what life might be like in science, but the
inadvertent effect is that some of us get swept up into the whirlwind of
result-driven work, of doing whatever it takes to get to these checkpoints,
without necessarily enjoying the process, all the while feeling dirty about
how I’ve lost sight of the real goal of science. Funny enough, I came across a
quote on Twitter of <a href="https://researchtopracticeconnections.wordpress.com/2016/09/24/losing-
your-way-as-a-scientist-how-not-to-suck/">someone else’s
blog</a> speaking to this exact issue:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/blog/2016-09-12-year2-advice.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For a while, I was just so tired of working on the same damn thing every
single day, to the point that I forgot what the point of any of that science
is, other than to publish a paper so I can be on my way towards a PhD.
“Intellectual cul-de-sac” is one way to put it, running through a pool of
cornstarch is another way - why the fuck am I even doing this?</p>

<p>A good analogy, I think, is something I learned in the business world. For a
while, I was on the start-up bandwagon, and one of the few consistent lessons
that successful entrepreneurs tell is to aim to produce value, and not
revenue. If a product tries its best to improve people’s lives, then people
will buy it, whereas focusing on revenue will only result in cutting corners
for the sake of maximizing profit. I always thought this was a no-brainer, but
I didn’t realize how applicable it was in science. In hindsight, the only
thing I should’ve focused on is to produce solid and reliable research, to the
best of my abilities and knowledge, something that gets us incrementally
closer to the truth, instead of setting goals like getting papers and grants.
It would have been extremely difficult to not give into the pressures of
career and academia, but would have brought peace amidst the chaotic process
of discovery. I’m not saying I did BAD science, if that’s what that sounds
like, I’m just saying the pressure of “reality” can suck the fun out of a lot
things. Looking back now, I think the key to wading through all that noise is
<strong>integrity</strong> : a coherence between my actions and my values. This may partly
diminish the effect of imposter’s syndrome as well, as the expectations and
image of myself will have more closely aligned with the day to day activities,
of when I do good work and bad work.</p>

<p>The last thing is something I realized about science, which re-invigorated my
excitement in continuing my PhD. For a while, I had thought that the point of
doing research is to confirm hypotheses, finding evidence for the theories we
have. But through the gift of failure, I realized that the truly important
discoveries are the observations that defied all logic and expectation,
spectacular failures that change the landscape of how people subsequently view
the field. These, of course, are far and few, because most of the time we have
a fairly good theory of how something works. This is especially true in a
mature field like physics and chemistry - observations should be roughly
consistent with the theories we have, because we’ve spent a LONG time
developing those theories. Neuroscience, as well as cognitive and
psychological sciences in general, are not like that, and especially after the
recent fiasco in reproducibility and shoddy stats in fMRI, it’s apparent that
we don’t have as good of theories (or experimental procedures) as other
sciences, and there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a complicated thing we’re
studying here, to say the least, especially when the ethics board is insistent
that we don’t implant electrodes in undergrad brains. What IS problematic is
the bias for positive findings consistent with pre-existing theories,
especially in cog/psych/neuro. All this is to say that, 999 out of 1000 times,
a negative result may be due to mistakes or noise, but that one single time
out of a thousand is the money-maker, and instead of wallowing in the
disappointment of negative results, I should bask in the joy of new-found
opportunity. So positive or negative, as long as we keep doing what we believe
is right, there really is no bad outcomes, because <strong>science, more or less, is
the business of looking for other people’s (and your own) mistakes</strong>. This may
already be obvious to experienced scientists who have had the rigorous
training (or osmosis) in philosophy of science, but for a newbie like me, it
really is a drastic shift in perspective. A happy side effect is that I feel
like I’m much more critical of things I read now, because when I first started
out, I thought if you publish something, that MUST mean it’s true, and so I
should just try to absorb everything I can. But after TWO YEARS, I finally,
somehow, learned to critically evaluate new research, probably because a bunch
of those findings contradict each other or make no sense. The challenge now is
to be balanced, and not be OVER-critical or be an asshole about it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Anyway, this is getting long so I’ll try to wrap it up. I still distinctively
remember thoughts from 6 months ago, something to the likes of “wow things are
really going much better than I had anticipated right now, I hope it doesn’t
get there but I wonder how I will be able to deal with a major disaster.”
Well, shit happens and I’m still getting paid minimum wage to throw away my
golden years trying to study something that’s not even clear will ever be
solved. So, life’s still good. In all seriousness, I’ve had doubts about
whether I’m cut out for science, as well as whether science is a worthwhile
enterprise in trying to understand the brain and cognition, but through all
that, the opportunities out there in discovering the unknown and maybe
improving people’s lives are just too enticing, so I’m still chugging along.
As I write this today, and as bad as the story may have sounded, it was a
pretty great year. I learned a TON of new things and became more comfortable
with science, exercised pretty regularly, and did not lose any friends or
family members. So I’m pretty grateful for how things have turned out, even
the hiccups along the road.</p>

<p>As always, if you’ve had or are having similar struggles, whether in science
school or whatever school or at an actual job (hah), I hope my experience
helps you, either by avoiding the same roadblocks or providing comfort in
knowing that things will be okay.</p>

<p>Well, until next year!</p>
