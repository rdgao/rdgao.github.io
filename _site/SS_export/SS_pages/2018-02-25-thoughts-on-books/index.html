<h1><strong>Top Shelf</strong></h1>
<p>These books here are literally on the top of my shelf, and I plan to read them at least more than once. They are here for one (or all) of the following reasons:<br>1) it's been life-changing and shaped the way I went about life , and I'd pretty much recommend it to everyone to at least flip through - it won't be a waste of time.<br>2) it deeply resonated with me on some personal level and made me understand myself a little better, and I'd <strong>strongly </strong>recommend it to someone who I feel similar to with regards to some personality trait, thoughts on a particular topic, or past life experiences.</p>
<p><strong>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</strong><br>Stephen Covey</p>

<p><strong>All the Light We Cannot See</strong><br>Anthony Doerr</p>

<h1><strong>Pretty Good</strong></h1>
<p>These books are either classics that I liked, or something I found at least pretty interesting/well-written. They're listed by the chronological order that I read them in (date of completion near the bottom of the notes). If something in the notes speaks to you, I recommend checking them out.</p>
