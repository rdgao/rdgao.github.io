        <p>March 16, 2017 (For week of March 6)</p>

<p>I was thinking to myself the other day: “hmm, I haven’t come across a really
shitty news article about brain science recently, I wonder if science
journalists in the neurosciences stepped up their game after feeling the
pressure from my intensely popular blog posts about science communication?”</p>

<p>Then, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/03/01/scientists-
discover-how-to-download-knowledge-to-your-brain/">this gem</a> dropped out of the sky into
my lap (thanks Kelvin). Give it a read, it’s worth it.</p>

<p><img src="/squarespace_images/static_5351781ce4b0757a373c3d73_535182ade4b0bcfb2b4574dd_58ca266a2994ca8ee765de6b_1489643352873_Screen+Shot+2017-03-16+at+12.44.52+AM.png.52+AM.png_" alt="I can't think of a more click-bait name than this, honestly. Whatever
they're paying these people, it's not
enough." />
I can’t think of a more click-bait name than this, honestly. Whatever they’re
paying these people, it’s not enough.</p>

<p>Are you not entertained?</p>

<p>Apparently, since I last popped my head up from working on some trivial
problems in neuroscience, somebody had gone and figured out how to directly
upload knowledge to our brains! (I had to look thrice to make sure that this
wasn’t the fucking Onion.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whoa, I know Kung-Fu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What journalists think scientists did:</strong><br />
So, what happened here? Well, first, according to this news article,
“scientists” believe that we could soon feed knowledge directly into the brain
Matrix-style, and researchers “claim” to have already developed a stimulator
that can do so. Uh…so which is it? Can we already do it or will we be able
to do it soon? And who the hell are these scientists and researchers claiming
that?</p>

<p>Okay, nevermind that. On the next line, we learn that apparently it only
“amplifies” learning, and on a much smaller scale than seen in Matrix. This is
Good Journalism 101: if your readers are not disappointed by the third
paragraph, you’re not doing it right.</p>

<p>But wait! On the very NEXT line, it says that scientists “studied electric
signals in the brain of a trained pilot and fed the data into novice
subjects…and improved their piloting abilities and learned the task 33%
better.” The article goes on to conclude with some words like “neuro-
plasticity” and “synergy of cognitive and motor performance”, and reminds us
that Egyptians used electric fish to stimulate the brain some 4000 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>What I think the scientists did after reading this article:</strong><br />
So the article itself sends some confusing messages. In the best possible
interpretation (or is it the worst?), these scientists were able to directly
upload the skills of flying a flight simulator into some novice brains. This
is fucking groundbreaking! Why? This implies that we’ve broken the code with
which the brain encodes information, such as concepts of altitude and speed,
as well as motor commands. Not only that, we can now upload that information
directly and through digital means in a completely nonchalant way to random
volunteers! Why the hell do we still have training programs?!? This is
literally Captain America: the Winter Soldier!</p>

<p>Okay, maybe this optimal reading is a bit too literal (I mean literal as in
I’m literally reading the words that are showing up on my screen.) Afterall,
had that been true, this paper probably would’ve been in Nature AND Science in
the same week, not Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. Nothing wrong with
Frontiers, I just don’t typically see papers casually break the neural code
there, that’s all.</p>

<p>So then, to be fair, this news article pares back and seems to inject a hint
of actual scientific rigor. In this interpretation, scientists recorded brain
signals from trained pilots and played them back into the novices’ brains
through an electrical stimulator. Having adjusted my expectations
appropriately as such, I was actually pretty excited about this result. The
method itself is plausible enough: record voltage fluctuations on the scalp
(EEG) of the professional, and play it back on the scalp of the novice, and
apparently it facilitates learning! This would also be pretty groundbreaking
(less sarcastically so) and it would ask many more questions than it would
answer, such as: “why the hell should that work at all?” Everyone’s EEG is
pretty unique, and if playing that back onto someone else’s brain helps them
learn, it would mean that there are some invariant brain signatures that
represent certain skills or information in general. I can hardly contain my
excitement at this point. So I dig up <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00034/full">the
paper</a>,
and what did these folks do?</p>

<p><strong>What the scientists actually did:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sham or actual tDCS was applied with the Starstim system (Neuroelectrics)
following the finger tapping task (see Figure 1A). The total current applied
was 2 mA, with scalp current density of 0.04 A/m2 for active tDCS (for 60
min), or 0.1 mA (0.002 A/m2) for sham tDCS (for 1 min).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— Methods: tDCS. Choe et al., 2016</p>

<p>Fuck you, the Telegraph.</p>

<hr />

<p>Addendum: I would’ve ended this rant right there, but I think my non-
neuroscience friends wouldn’t get the joke. Basically, tDCS is a method of
brain stimulation, a very unsophisticated one at that. tDCS stands for
transcranial Direct Current Stimulation. Transcranial as in through the head,
and Direct Current as in…that’s right, direct current. Essentially, tDCS is
connecting a (or many) 9 Volt battery to your head such that a steady flow of
electrons comes out of the battery and through your head. It is as unexciting
as you could possibly make brain stimulation to be (though it is literally
shocking), and it certainly does not track the “recorded brain signal of the
professional pilot”. I don’t even know where this journalist person got that
idea from. I re-read the Methods section like 4 times just to make sure I
didn’t miss something that was super important, but nowhere in there (nor in
the abstract &amp; introduction) does it mention variable brain stimulation. As
far as I can tell, the innovation in this study is the concurrent recording of
brain signals with brain stimulation, and a more focal/ spatially precise way
of stimulating the brain, which is achieved through a new fancy system. Other
than that, the experiment is literally to compare the performance of those
that were hooked up to a battery during training versus those that weren’t.</p>

<p>Addendum to the addendum: I honestly can’t imagine how this news article could
have come out so wrong. It seems like the main authors of the scientific paper
are not at an academic institution, so perhaps their PR team wasn’t equipped
with dealing with “science journalism”. I cannot imagine what the authors must
be thinking right now, though I suppose there is no bad publicity, especially
if people won’t even realize this is bad publicity. For all I know, somebody
could’ve read this and thought we can plug into the Matrix now, and that’s
where I swoop in and save the day from bad science journalism. Go me! Also, I
realized I did not make a comment on the actual scientific finding, which is
that, as unsophisticated as zapping your brain with a (DC) battery is, it led
to actual performance gains overall, as measured by some flight-landing
metrics. I honestly don’t know too much here, but I will say that this finding
falls squarely within a larger context of the contentious debate about whether
tDCS actually does something to your brain, as <a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.mx/2016/04/what-we-think-we-know-and-dont-
know.html">summarized very nicely
here</a>.</p>

<p>So the take-home message? Please, for the love of god, don’t get your science
from the Telegraph.</p>
