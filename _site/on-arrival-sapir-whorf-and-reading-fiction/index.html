        <p>(Cover image source: Arrival)</p>

<p>When I was younger - I’m talking about middle-school age - I read all sorts of
books for fun. Captain Underpants, Artemis Fowl, and Harry Potter immediately
come to mind. As I grew older, though, I stopped reading fictions altogether,
and the little leisure reading I did do, I read almost exclusively non-fiction
or facts-of-the-world types of books. Not only did I stop reading fiction, I
took pride in not wasting time on stories. After all, if I wanted to entertain
myself with a good story, I can watch a movie in a tenth of the time, and I
can use the other nine tenths to learn some more math and science (NERD!).
This was partly because I was actually very busy studying math and sciences,
and partly because I hated high school English so much that I thought it would
turn me off reading forever, not understanding that people can actually enjoy
reading Shakespeare and other literary works without explicitly analyzing the
iambic pentameters and centuries-old metaphors. In any case, after a 10-year
drought, I started reading leisurely again since last fall, because I now have
an hour-long bus commute as a part of my day. At first, I read just as a way
to relax and get away from my usual riveting readings about neuroscience. But
slowly, I have to say, I realized that reading works of literature and seeing
how words can be combined in different ways to describe feelings has literally
changed the way I experience the world, and the way I experience myself.</p>

<p>If you’ve seen the film Arrival, or read the book, you will know that the
premise of the story is that a linguistic professor was able to experience
time in nonlinear ways due to the nonlinear alien language she learned. If you
haven’t, don’t worry - that’s not quite enough to spoil the movie and it’s
still worth a watch. While the notion that anything can warp our perception of
time might take some stretch of imagination, the idea that language shapes the
way we think does not. In fact, the movie itself cites the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis</a>, or the
theory of linguistic relativity. I must say, when I heard Amy Adams make
explicit reference to it, I felt a tiny geeky giddiness, because I actually
learned about this in graduate school. It’s the same giddiness I got when I
saw Johnny Depp trying to upload his mind into a computer in Transcendence,
even though that movie made no f-ing sense. Anyway, my understanding of
linguistic relativity pales in comparison to some of my friends and peers that
are actually conducting research on this very topic, but the gist of it is
that language is <strong>necessary</strong> for complex thoughts, the thoughts we have
depend greatly on the language we speak, and different cultures “think
differently”, in a way, because of the different languages they speak. When I
first learned about this theory three years ago, it was pretty easy to digest,
and made no great impression on me. After all, it was not at all surprising to
think that a native Chinese speaker would think in Chinese, and because of the
difference in vocabulary, some concepts and cultural customs are simply not
transferable to an English speaker. But I think I took it too literally, and
re-learning the theory once again through a movie, during a time that I am, in
a way, learning a new language through literary works, made me appreciate it
so much more.</p>

<p>In essence, language is not only a tool that we use to outwardly describe
concepts and thoughts to others, it is also the primary tool that we use to
communicate to ourselves - through thoughts. Furthermore, language literally
gives us access to some concepts that would otherwise not exist. In other
words, annotating something for the first time with language defines and
“creates” it, especially if this “something” cannot be captured with any other
sensory modalities. For example, if we did not have a word for apples, it’s
something that can still be materialized in our thoughts by ways of imagining
its sight, smell, taste, and the sound the fruit makes when we bite into it.
In that way, even though it will be a lot more difficult when you try to tell
someone you want to buy an apple, the concept itself can (probably?) still
exist, its meaning anchored through our senses. On the other hand, for
something as abstract and fleeting as an emotion or feeling, it’s quite
difficult to capture without words. Try to think about “sadness” without using
the word, you will probably need to resort to a bodily feeling, like a
tightness in your chest, or some previous memory that put you in that state of
mind, like when you dropped a perfectly good ice cream cone. Some people are
incredibly apt at relating their previous emotional experiences to new ones,
such that old memories of the same feeling can serve as an anchor, and perhaps
this is the skill (or talent) of empathy. Unfortunately, I am not such a
person, and my emotional memory is very limited, both in detail and in how far
back I can remember, so I can’t really rely on that to process even my own
feelings time and time again, much less intuitively understand someone else’s.
In fact, I thought emotions were so uncomplicated that I actively maintained
that there are, scientifically speaking, only 6 elementary and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ekman#Emotions_as_universal_categories">universal
emotions</a>
that can be described with single English words (happy, sad, angry, etc.).</p>

<p>For that reason, reading about detailed and intricate descriptions of how
fictional characters feel, contextualized in the larger story where I
understand their origins and goals and dreams and fears, has really opened my
eyes to how <strong>I feel</strong>, and in turn, how others might feel. Many a times, I
have read a passage with the joyous feeling that, not only does someone else -
someone wielding this pen - understand precisely how I’ve felt before, but
that they gave me the words so that I can for the first time understand how I
feel myself. It’s crazy. I recently finished reading All the Light We Cannot
See, and I wrote a <a href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2017/4/17/1552-language-beetles-bruce-lee-all-the-light-we-cannot-see">few weeks</a> ago about a particular passage that feels so
mundane, yet it’s so accurate in its description of the frustration and
helplessness one feels while trying to read under distraction - even though it
never used those words. Another example: I am nearing the end of the Glass
Bead Game by Hermann Hesse, and the subtle descriptions of Joseph Knecht’s
tranquility and sorrow simply cannot be substituted by the words “content” and
“sad”. Without delving too much into the book, I feel like I’ve learned for
the first time that it is possible to think and feel at the same time, and in
turn how I can process other people’s simultaneous thoughts and feelings on
the fly. To me, it feels like wiping the condensation off of my mirror for the
first time and seeing a part of myself I’ve never seen before. And with that,
I feel like I understood the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis just a little more, and
I’m pleasantly surprised that it actually has implications in my own personal
life. Actually, the idea that reading quality literature gives you a window
into someone else’s feelings is not new: I remember reading
<a href="http://www.rdgao.com/blog/2017/4/17/1552-language-beetles-bruce-lee-all-the-light-we-cannot-see">this</a> a few years ago but apparently completely forgot
about it, probably during a time where I thought: “leisure reading? hah,
that’s nice.” But evidently there is scientific support for the theory that
literature can make you more empathetic to the feelings of others.</p>

<p>Extending this away from feelings and into a broader context: can you imagine
a world without concepts of freedom, justice, and democracy? Well, I’m
starting 1984, so I guess I will soon find out.</p>
